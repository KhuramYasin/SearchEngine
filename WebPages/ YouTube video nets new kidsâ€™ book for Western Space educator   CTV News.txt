(Source: Western University) Exeter, Ont. - A Western University astrophysicist is now a children's author. A YouTube video from Parshati Patel caught the eye of publishers from Penguin Random House and has resulted in a newly released book that aims to teach kids about space. â€œShe [the publisher] was looking for someone who could talk to a young audience and that video resonated with her,â€? said Patel, who has spent most of the past decade as a space scholar, science communicator and STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) educator. According to a release from Western, space has intrigued Patel since she looked through her first telescope as a young girl, so itâ€™s natural that telescopes are among the topics she chose to write about.An excerpt from Parshati Patel's book, 'My Book of Stars and Planets' (Source: Western University)They include the SOFIA telescope, a flying observatory circling the Earth aboard a specially designed Boeing 747. Other topics include constellations, meteorites and asteroids, space technology, pioneers such as orbit mathematician Katherine Johnson, and answers to questions such as, â€˜Why is space black?â€™ â€œThere are so many cool things about space, so it was sometimes a matter of eliminating the least-cool stuff,â€? said Patel. She hopes it will add fuel to the spark of curiosity most children have about space. â€œThis simple book could intrigue and inspire other kids around the world.â€?
