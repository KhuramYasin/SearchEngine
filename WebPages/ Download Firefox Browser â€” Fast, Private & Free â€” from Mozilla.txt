Firefox Browser collects so little data about you, we donâ€™t even require your email address to download. Thatâ€™s because unlike other browsers, we have no financial stake in following you around the web. How we compare to other browsers Compare Firefox to: ChromeEdgeSafari Blocks third-party tracking cookies by default Autoplay blocking Blocks social trackers OS availability In-browser screenshot tool Primary password We block the ad trackers. You explore the internet faster. Ads are distracting and make web pages load slower while their trackers watch every move you make online. The Firefox Browser blocks most trackers automatically, so thereâ€™s no need to dig into your security settings. See your protection report Firefox is for everyone Available in over 90 languages, and compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux machines, Firefox works no matter what youâ€™re using or where you are. Make sure your operating system is up to date for the best experience. Review system requirements Put Firefox on all your devices Take your privacy with you everywhere. Firefox Browsers for iOS and Android have the same strong privacy settings to block trackers from following you around the web, no matter where you are.

Backed by the non-profit that puts people first Challenging the status quo since 1998 Firefox was created by Mozilla as a faster, more private alternative to browsers like Internet Explorer, and now Chrome.

Your data, your web activity, your life online is protected with Firefox. Keep all your favorite browser features â€” and discover new ones. Works with Google products All your favorite Google tools (like Gmail and Docs) work seamlessly in the Firefox Browser.
