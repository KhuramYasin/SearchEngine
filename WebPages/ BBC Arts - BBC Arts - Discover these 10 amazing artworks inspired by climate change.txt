Here's a collection of innovative film, audio and digital experiences inspired by the fight to curb climate change, including works by John Grant and Yoko Ono. A remote landscape scarred by human activity Artist and activist Georgia Tucker uses virtual reality to show viewers worlds that are both alien and familiar. Her latest piece, Conniveo, provides a poignant glimpse of a landscape far from civilisation but still scarred by human activity. She said: "There are no islands on Earth left untarnished by human pollution. We have turned the ocean into a dumping ground."

Searching for new ways to get people thinking about these fragile ecosystems, she teamed up with bioacoustics expert Dr Tim Gordon to create an interactive musical experience. Her project, Sonmare, is a virtual reality experience that allows users to interact with a series of underwater landscapes using a MIDI synthesizer or computer keyboard. These provide the soundtrack for a suite of 3D modelled ocean animals, allowing viewers to see worlds they might otherwise never experience. In three different scenarios, viewers can bring a bleached coral reef back to life, illuminate arctic sea ice and interact with a pod of humpback whales.
