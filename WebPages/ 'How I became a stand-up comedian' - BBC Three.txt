Hannah Price6 November 2021 Real Life Share this: Copy this linkRead more about sharing In her last term at University of York in 2015, Anna came down with glandular fever – the illness left her bed bound and meant she had to drop out of university until she recovered. "I was just jumping from job to job, whilst waiting to go back, and not having a nice time, and I sort of hit rock bottom," she says. At the time, Anna says she was listening to lots of comedy podcasts to keep her going. "I’m a massive comedy fan but I never considered doing it myself. But I was listening and I thought these are real people, they weren’t born with a microphone in their hands – they decided, 'Oh I want to do stand up comedy’ and they pursued it." That’s when Anna saw an advert for a comedy course in Manchester, “I just thought I have nothing to lose at this point, I feel rubbish. "I did it and haven’t looked back ever. "Glandular fever was good and bad in a way. I was running about uni and I was just applying for graduate jobs that I didn’t really care about. "It made me pause and think. The world was like, 'Stop what you’re doing, do you really want to go into HR?' – I’m still not sure if I really knew what jobs I was applying for." 'Lots of material comes from my mam' Looking back at her first gig, after finishing the comedy course, Anna, who grew up in Burry Port Wales, says her jokes needed work. "My material was awful. I think other Welsh comedians found this as well, but I just did lots of sheep jokes," Anna says. "I think it’s a defensive thing, especially because I was living in England. I was like 'Right, I’ll get ready. Everyone’s going to baa at me when I go on stage'. But no-one does that. I’m still yet to have a sheep noise made. "Although if I ever have one... I’m ready," she laughs. Now, Anna draws on her family for inspiration. "Lots is coming from my mam, she’s rich in material – the daft stuff she comes out with. "Recently, we’ve had a robin knocking on our window. Turns out robins, when they see their reflection, go into a primal state and they attack themselves in the reflection. "So my mam’s been trying to get it to stop, so she’s been drawing all over the windows in highlighter because apparently that stops the reflection. "Just imagine that constantly." 'There’s not enough working-class comedians' BBC When Anna got to university, she says she didn’t realise how different it was growing up in Burry Port, Wales. "It was a bit of a culture shock when I moved to York,” she says. “A lot of people went to private schools and grammar schools." "And in our history class in my school back in Wales they taught us grammar schools were all closed, and they forgot to tell us that was just in Wales," she laughs. Speaking about some of the differences she found as a student, Anna says she was in the minority of students that were working multiple jobs. At weekends, she would work during the day at River Island and then work in bars at night. "Sometimes I’d have to send money home and stuff, in that way it was just a bit different. But everyone was lush and I’m very grateful for my upbringing, she says." Since Anna started in comedy she thinks the industry has already started to get more diverse. "I’ve noticed the comedy club line ups are getting to be less of the same four white men", she says. Growing up, Anna says she didn’t see a lot of people like her on TV. "Especially being working class, I didn’t see a lot of people doing anything creative as jobs, like comedy, writing, anything like that. So it was hard to envision it. "I think it’s so important to have that diversity so other people can watch themselves on the screen and then that will inspire even more diversity and more creativity and more exciting things in comedy." 'I can’t believe I won' More than 1,000 comics applied to this year’s big comedy talent search, the BBC New Comedy Awards. Anna was one of six finalists that took the stage in a bid to be crowned the BBC New Comedian of 2021. Previous awards helped build the careers of some of Britain’s most popular comedians, including Peter Kay, Sarah Millican, Alan Carr, Romesh Ranganathan, Lee Mack and Russell Howard. Anna says when her name was read out as the winner, she misheard it. "I didn’t think I’d have won it. It was such a strong line up and going last, I saw how well everyone did. And I was like, 'You know it’s just nice to be out, isn’t it'. "It was such a lush experience from the get go, meeting so many different comedians from all across the UK – like, I wouldn’t really get a chance usually to, because I don’t drive and stuff. "I’ve definitely been inspired. "Who knows what’s next, but I’m blooming excited for it", she says. Anna’s tips for getting into comedy "I say just do it, get into it. "There’s so many sources out there now to sort of help you. "Get out there, make videos, there’s so many amazing open mics and things. Even if you go watch a couple to begin with, to sort of dip your toe in and sort of get used to [it]. "Get out there, get writing, You can do it! The comedy community can be very welcoming and that, just jump into it." The BBC New Comedy Awards is available to watch on BBC iPlayer now.
