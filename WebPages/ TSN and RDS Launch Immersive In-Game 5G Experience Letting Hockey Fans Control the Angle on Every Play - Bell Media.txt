Making its debut tonight on TSN and RDSâ€™s regional coverage of the Montreal Canadiensâ€™ game against the Vancouver Canucks, this innovative 5G-enabled technology lets fans control how they view every angle of the game on their smartphones, getting up close to every goal, pass, hit and penalty with zoom, pause, rewind and slow motion capabilities made possible with Bellâ€™s superfast, high-capacity 5G mobile network. In addition to the immersive mobile experience, the new 5G technology also allows viewers of the TSN and RDS broadcasts to get closer to the action, featuring views from never-before-seen camera angles during in-game commentary, analysis, replays, and post-game recaps. â€œCombining Canadaâ€™s fastest mobile network with our leading sports properties allows hockey fans to benefit from our world-leading 5G technologyâ€™s ability to deliver an all-new sports viewing experience,â€? said Nauby Jacob, Bell Mediaâ€™s Senior Vice President, Product Platforms. â€œTSN 5G View / Vision 5G RDS is a great example of our commitment to leverage Bellâ€™s technology leadership to offer our customers the best content on the most innovative platforms.â€?

Weâ€™re literally handing control of the viewing experience to our fans through their Bell 5G smartphones,â€? said Nathalie Cook, Vice-President, TSN & RDS. â€œBecause they canâ€™t attend the games in person, we think hockey fans will be delighted with this innovative new option to get close to the action.â€?
