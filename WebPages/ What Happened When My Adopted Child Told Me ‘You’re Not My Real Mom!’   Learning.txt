I knew it was coming eventually. My kids are young adults and while they are often incredible, empathetic human beings, sometimes they are very much the opposite. Although my older daughter has never openly screamed this to me, my youngest teen is a different kettle of fish. When they barked that I was not their real mom, I had to handle it, but then came the next assault — "You are not my real dad!" It was levelled at my husband the night before we were preparing to drive eight hours to Quebec for our first family vacation since the pandemic began. Teenage Angst and Adoption Most adoptive families know that this will happen eventually. Teens test you like nobody else can, so what are adoptive teens really trying to say when they yell that you're not their real parent? And how am I supposed to handle it? "Words are weapons and tools and toys — and sometimes woefully inadequate clothing for emotions." What I've learned about teens is they can be the most mild-mannered, well-adjusted neurotypical kid in the world and yet, even still, they will try their parents at some point. Sometimes I wonder if this is biological, psychological or evolutionary. I ?asked this of a friend once — she raised four teens — and she said, "Yes, all of the above." I ?have two of them, and I am baffled by how one week a kid could be holding your hand on the walk to the bus stop, and a month later they are screaming, "You can't tell me what to do! I ?hate you and I can't wait to move out." ?And all you might have been asking was for them to pick up their clothes. For teens who have experienced foster care or adoption, these outbursts can sometimes dig a bit deeper: "You can't tell me what to do! ?You are not even my real mom!" Cue huge eye roll. I guess I am supposed to be wounded to the core when they utter those words that are clearly meant to wound. But truthfully, most days I am not. I write, edit and communicate messages all day long. Words are weapons and tools and toys — and sometimes woefully inadequate clothing for emotions. When Paula was first asked her "birth story," she wasn't sure what to say since her kids are adopted. That's why she'd like such stories to evolve to be more inclusive. Who Is 'Real' In The Adoption Process? In one way or another, I’ve heard this message routinely since the kids joined our family. I heard people suggest it when we first attended that baby gym class where everyone went around in a circle to tell their birth stories and I was singled out as the adoptive parent. I have heard it bluntly uttered from neighbours: "Where’s the real mom?" "Where are the real parents?" I once wrote about the harm done by strangers who ask in front of my kids: "Are they real sisters?" "Real" is an odd word, and it's used when people don’t seem to understand the nature of adoption. There’s a birth parent or a birth family, a child and then the adoptive family. Who in this triad is not real? I am pretty sure that we all are. "Adoption was real for us from the moment we decided to build our family this way." Adoption was real for us from the moment we decided to build our family this way. It was real from the second we filled out the mounds of paperwork asking if we were able to parent children with various disabilities and it’s been real all the days afterwards. Heartbreakingly so at times. "You are not my real mom" was one of those statements the local Children’s Aid Society warned us about when we did the pre-adoption training two decades ago now. They told us, at some point, we would hear from our child that we're not their real parent. I expected this much earlier, but both of my kids danced around it for years. When my oldest was a five-year-old and I'd catch her in a lie over schoolwork or something relatively minor, she’d walk out the door declaring she was leaving. She repeated that routine for a few years. It doesn’t take a psychologist or social worker to recognize that was her way of testing boundaries and questioning unconditional love. What is real? Who stays? Did I still love her if I was mad or disappointed? You bet I did. But she re-enacted this game over and over. "Kids know when they are different. It doesn’t need to be pointed out at every single opportunity." Paula is tired of people asking her kids if they're "real sisters." The Teen Years As An Adoptee I believe in parenting that the angriest kids with the worst behaviour sometimes need the most love. I have seen it, felt it, heard it and I live with it many days. For an entire summer before this outburst, as my youngest grappled with identity and life during a pandemic, I heard curiosity, anger and statements to friends about their real mom or their real dad. We were also there for all their questions. "As they are getting ready to leave home, it brings up issues of what permanent family looks like and whether that ends at 18 or 19." “Do I look like my real dad?” “You have your birth dad’s jawline.” “Am I taller than my real mom?” “You are about the same height as your birth mom.” A few things I have learned about parenting adoptive teens — sometimes they are prickly like typical teens, but it’s also accompanied by a bit of conflict. As they are getting ready to leave home, it brings up issues of what permanent family looks like and whether that ends at 18 or 19. Do we stay a family after that? The answer is of course, but perhaps it’s not so obvious to a teen who came to their family via foster care or adoption. So, on a night when they are angry and hollering "You are not my real mom!" — I suppose I am not all that concerned. I don’t take it personally anymore. I can’t. And yet it’s a different story just a few weeks later, when we are about to leave for a family vacation and my teen launches into a full-on screaming match with her dad. 'You’re not my real dad!' That’s the arrow that lands the mark, even as I am not the target it smarts. It's for my husband of 28 years, the one who has driven the kids to martial arts twice a week since the kids were four. The one who rarely complains about anything, is absurdly patient and who woke with them as many times as I did to chase away nightmares and ear infections. I didn’t expect that would be the one to hit home. "Real" is defined as actually existing or happening, not imaginary, not fake or false. There are no false notes in the angry outbursts, the rants or rages. Nor are there in the love, the pride, the ups and downs or the disappointment that follows when a kid, adopted or not, lashes out at a parent. I am sure this is not the last time we will deal with this intended insult, and it’s not the last time someone will question whether adoption is real or not. Just like all the members of the adoption triad are real, all the pieces and the feelings and moments between are real — whether happy, hurtful or otherwise.
