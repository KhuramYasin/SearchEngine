The story follows the foul-mouthed, chirp-serving, mother-loving, fan-favourite character, Shoresy, as he joins a senior AAA hockey team in a quest to never, ever lose again. Thatâ€™s just one of many things happening in the world of LETTERKENNY, and a trailer for Season 10 – which debuts on Christmas day – can be seen here. BTS and Coldplay are teaming up to perform their hit song My Universe for the first time at the 49th annual AMERICAN MUSIC AWARDS, airing live from Los Angeles, Sunday at 8 p.m. ET on CTV. Other scheduled performers during the Cardi B-hosted show include Olivia Rodrigo, Bad Bunny with Tainy and Juliete Venegas, Carrie Underwood and Jason Aldean, Diplo, and more. And speaking of musical celebrations, a new HBO special featuring all the highlights from the 2021 ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME INDUCTION CEREMONY – which some have said was the best ceremony in years – will be available for streaming tomorrow, at 8 p.m. ET on Crave. Might the sharp-tongued Roman Roy really be the most sentimental and family-oriented of all the Roy siblings on HBO’s SUCCESSION? Kieran Culkin, who plays Roman, examines that possibility in an interview with TV critic Bill Harris for The Lede, while also explaining the calculated reason why he doesn’t dive too deeply into trying to understand Roman. As Season 3 of SUCCESSION continues, Roman gets political – literally and figuratively – in a new episode, Sunday on Crave. Coming Up Nov. 22, 2021 It was a massive controversy at the time, but looking back at it almost 18 years later, the long-term effects are perhaps even more startling. Part of The New York Times Presents series, the new documentary MALFUNCTION: THE DRESSING DOWN OF JANET JACKSON is available for streaming now on Crave. It tells the tale of the infamous “wardrobe malfunction” during the SUPER BOWL halftime show in 2004, when Justin Timberlake ripped off part of Jackson’s costume, and how their careers subsequently, and unfairly, went in completely opposite directions. An epic drama that follows the millionaire titans of New York City in the 1880s, a new trailer and first-look photos for HBO’s THE GILDED AGE have been released, and are also available on The Lede. The long-awaited period drama – which is set to debut on Jan. 24, 2022, only on Crave – is a nine-part series from DOWNTON ABBEY creator Julian Fellowes, and stars Carrie Coon, Morgan Spector, DenÃ©e Benton, Louisa Jacobson, and Taissa Farmiga, among others, with Cynthia Nixon and Christine Baranski in supporting roles.
