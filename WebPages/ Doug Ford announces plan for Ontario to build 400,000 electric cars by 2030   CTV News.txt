Premier Doug Ford and economic development minister Vic Fedeli made an announcement at Linamar in Guelph, Ont. Wednesday, unveiling phase two of the province's auto strategy. â€œOur government has a plan to unleash Ontarioâ€™s economic potential as we build up home-grown supply chains for electric vehicles and battery manufacturing,â€? said Ford. â€œThis plan makes clear that Ontario is a world-leading partner in creating the best vehicles with the best labour force and clean energy.â€? The province says the goal is to grow Ontarioâ€™s auto sector by building at least 400,000 electric and hybrid vehicles by 2030. To do this, the Ontario government says itâ€‹ will partner with the auto sector to reposition vehicle and parts production through new mandates, attract a new battery assembly plant, increase exports of parts and innovations, equip workers with skills for high-paying jobs, and establish an electric battery supply chain ecosystem that connects Northern Ontarioâ€™s mineral wealth with the manufacturing strength of Southern Ontario. "Before the election I didn't believe in giving millionaires rebates on over-$100,000 Tesla cars, nothing against Tesla cars, they're beautiful cars, but I just didn't believe in it, let's see how the market dictates," said Ford. "We're putting billions and billions into the electric vehicle market, into companies, and we're partnering with the federal government." The province has committed $56.4 million over the next four years to go towards innovation in auto tech systems.
