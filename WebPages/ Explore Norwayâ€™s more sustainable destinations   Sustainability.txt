About the environment, their unique culture, the local community, and last but not least – your wellbeing. Travel smooth and visit a more sustainable destination on your next adventure. Dynamic Variation: Default There are many positive sides to tourism, but the industry is also faced with challenges. If you’re eager to experience a unique destination that can give you memories for life, and also cares for the locals by ensuring that your environmental footprint stays as low as possible, you should visit places in Norway that are labelled as sustainable destinations. Here, you can get more than a beautiful experience, as you also help preserve local communities and cultural heritage while making the destinations an enjoyable place to live and visit. Please keep in mind, though, that the destinations might not yet be 100 per cent sustainable in every sense, but they are working hard to get better and better every day. If you seek unforgettable cultural experiences, you can travel to super cosy small towns filled with traditions, such as Røros, Lærdal or the villages in Setesdal. You can also visit the sporty arts and literature city of Lillehammer or experience the combination of culture and farming along The Golden Road at Inderøy in Trøndelag. Some of Norway’s most breathtaking landscapes can be found in the Geirangerfjord area – the deep blue fjord surrounded by majestic, snow-covered mountain peaks, wild waterfalls, and lush vegetation is on the UNESCO World Heritage List for a reason – and in the wild islands of Lofoten and Vesterålen. With their unique stories and local culinary specialities, these destinations will provide you with a beautiful combination of culture, activities, and food. Mountain biking in the Lyngenfjord region. Photo: Visit Lyngenfjord / www.visit-lyngenfjord.com / Lyngen Lindesnes lighthouse, Norway's southernmost point. Photo: Inger Hutchinson / Visit SÃ¸rlandet Kayaking in Femund Engerdal. Photo: Thomas Rasmus Skaug / Visitnorway.com Winter in RÃ¸ros. Photo: Thomas Rasmus Skaug / Visitnorway.com If fantastic nature experiences are what you’re searching for, it will be well worth your time to visit the activity and ski touring paradise of Lyngenfjord in the north or the Lysefjord and Suldal in the southwest – especially if you like majestic hiking and fjord experiences. The region of Lindesnes in the south can tempt you with the underwater restaurant Under, which you can visit after a trip to the southernmost point of Norway. And if you seek the peace and quiet of the countryside, you can find it in the deep forest of Femund Engerdal in Eastern Norway. Geilo and Trysil are Meccas for people who like to stay active all year round. This is no surprise, as the destinations offer some of the country’s most epic ski slopes in the winter. During the summer, the slopes turn into some of the best downhill and trail cycling tracks – perfect for the sporty adrenaline-seeking traveller. The mountains of Norefjell, just 90 minutes from Oslo, are another playground for skiers in the winter. Here, you can ski from 1,188 metres and down towards the frozen lake Krøderen at 130 meters – ideal for both families and daredevils. In the summer and autumn, you can go hiking and biking through scenic landscapes, or relax at the golf course.
