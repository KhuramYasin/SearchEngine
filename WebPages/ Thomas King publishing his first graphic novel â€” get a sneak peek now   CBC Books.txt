Social Sharing Borders was illustrated by Natasha Donovan and will be available on Sept. 7, 2021 CBC Books Â· Posted: May 05, 2021 9:43 AM ET | Last Updated: May 6 Borders is a graphic novel by Thomas King, illustrated by Natasha Donovan. (CBC, HarperCollins) AcclaimedÂ writer Thomas King isÂ publishingÂ his first graphic novel. Borders was originally a short story written in 1993. It's about a boy and his mother who try to take aÂ road trip from Alberta to Salt Lake City. When they reach the American Canadian border, they identify asÂ Blackfoot, and not Canadian or AmericanÂ â€” causing problems and putting the pair in limbo between the two countries. What unfolds is a powerful story about justice, identity and belonging. Borders was adapted into a graphic novelÂ by Natasha Donovan. It will be published on Sept. 7, 2021. Â "Natasha's illustrations bring the story to light in a new and engaging way," King told CBC Books via email. KingÂ is a Canadian American writer of Cherokee and Greek ancestry who is regarded as one of the most influential Indigenous writers and scholars of his generation.Â King wasÂ the first Indigenous person to deliver a CBC Massey Lecture in 2003.Â His bestselling books includeÂ Truth & Bright Water,Â The Inconvenient Indian,Â Green Grass, Running Water,Â The Back of the TurtleÂ and the DreadfulWater mystery series. He's also written aÂ poetry collection, 77 Fragments of a Familiar Ruin. Thomas King is hopeful that his writing has changed the world â€” but he's still not sure Indians on VacationÂ is currently onÂ the shortlist for the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour and the Governor General's Literary Award for fiction.Â It was shortlisted forÂ the 2020 Writers' Trust Fiction PrizeÂ and longlisted forÂ the 2020 Scotiabank Giller Prize. Unreserved40:13An extended conversation with celebrated author Thomas KingRecorded at Montreal's Blue Metropolis International Literary Festival, Thomas King joins Rosanna Deerchild on stage in this extended conversation about writing, research and Indigenous humour. 40:13 Donovan is a MÃ©tis illustrator originally from Vancouver. She has illustrated several graphic novels, including the Surviving the City series by Tasha SpilletÂ and Brett Huson's animal series, which includesÂ The Sockeye Mother, The Grizzly Mother and The Eagle Mother. She also illustrated the cover for The Ghost Collector by Allison Mills and her work appears in the anthology This Place: 150 Years Retold. Borders is a story she has known for a long time, and has connected to personally as her partner is American and currently trying to navigate the same system. "I've been passionate about this story since I first read it in high school. It's funny and tender, in that quintessential Thomas King way, and it gracefully balances the absurdity and the heartbreak of arbitrarily imposed divisions," Donovan told CBC Books via email. "While working onÂ Borders, my American spouse and I were also getting to know the weird, frustrating world of immigration â€”Â in fact, the book is now finished, but my case is still unresolved. Working on this project in such a surprisingly relevant time was a huge privilege, and often a comfort. I have grown to love these characters immensely, and they have provided me with a lot of hope and happiness." You can see an excerpt from Borders below.
