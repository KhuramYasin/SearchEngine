My husband and I dressed our five-month-old up as a puppy, carefully placed her in her carseat and drove to our church for a "carnival day." My husband was an intern of the church at the time, and we spent the evening running carnival-themed events while our infant sat on my hip. I pictured our growing family spending every year celebrating Halloween within the warmth of the church walls. We’d dress up as cutesy cartoon characters or sweet farm animals. The church’s events would be fun for the kids, but we’d stay away from the eerie goblins and spooky witches lurking outside in the dark. I was determined to find some kind of merriment and fun on All Hallows' Eve, I just didn’t want any of the scary stuff. Paula Schuck is a mother of teens and the way she sees it, childhood is too short — so just let them trick-or-treat. A Halloween-less Childhood Ever since I was a child, I haven’t cared for Halloween. "I was taught and believed that October 31 was an evil day that didn’t require my participation." After accidentally watching a couple scenes of Scream when I was in second grade, I decided I hated scary movies and wanted nothing to do with the spooky season. By the time I was eight, I was eager to ditch the whole thing and stopped going out for trick-or-treating — it’s probably also worth mentioning I was an only child. When I was 11, I decided to start attending the nearby Baptist church. While my mom worked weekends, I’d ride my bike to church and spend the day volunteering at all of the services. As a teen and young adult, I embraced conservative evangelical Christianity. I was taught and believed that October 31 was an evil day that didn’t require my participation. There were other, more wholesome ways to celebrate. Looking for some DIY Halloween decorations? Try these spooky super-stringy spider webs made using string, glue and wax paper. Having Kids And Joining The Fun I’ve come a long way from the young mom with the puppy on her hip. Today I’m a seasoned mom of three young daughters, and my oldest is now nine. I’ve also ditched my old evangelical views and in recent years I’ve even embraced Halloween — creepy parts and all! "Even though I wasn’t a fan as a kid, I unleashed my inner child and discovered that I really did enjoy Halloween." Once my children started taking an interest in decorating our house and finding the perfect costume, I decided to join in on the fun. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed finding the best decorations for our house, carving pumpkins and watching scary movies all October long. Even though I wasn’t a fan as a kid, I unleashed my inner child and discovered that I really did enjoy Halloween. This year our family has already watched some of our favourite Halloween movies — Coraline, Hocus Pocus, Halloweentown, The Nightmare Before Christmas and The Addams Family. We’ve made our rounds to all the creepily decorated houses in our neighborhood. We’ve spent the day at Value Village, scouring the racks for our favourite costumes. On Halloween night, I’ll become mother to Wednesday Addams, Billie Eilish and Elsa. Our house is already decked out, but we still need to add some more spiderwebs. While I don’t typically dress up for Halloween, this year I’ve decided that I’m going to be a witch. When I told my daughter she gasped, "I thought you said that dressing up is only for kids?" But sometimes even parents change their minds.?
