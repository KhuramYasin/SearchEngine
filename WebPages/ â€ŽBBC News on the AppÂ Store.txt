Ratings and Reviews 4.4 out of 5 275.6K Ratings 275.6K Ratings Editorsâ€™ Notes The BBC News app is about as trusted a news source as youâ€™ll find, but what we really love is how it lets us create our own bespoke channel. Choose topics from a staggeringly comprehensive list, and suddenly youâ€™re getting just the stories that truly matter to you. It makes the challenge of keeping up with the world almost manageable. Normally pleased with apps , 21/04/2020 Good but frustrating at times My biggest frustration is clicking on a story which is of interest by its title and finding it only takes me to a general page where I have to scroll down for ages to try (and sometimes fail) to find the article I'm interested in. Another is leaving stories for many days or even weeks so that they block fresher news. When an existing news item is updated, often repeatedly and as indicated by the time under the title, you have no idea whether there's been a small change or major additions without re-reading it. Finally there are too many typos and similar; it makes me worry if the articles are sufficiently checked. I still score it with four stars, and I use the site a lot, but for the reasons I give it is frustrating. Achieng01923 , 05/11/2020 Not all news is equal Disappointing that African news (Africa Live) gets put all on one long page (like a parish notice), rather than webpage per item, like other news. It makes it so difficult to use and almost impossible to share a story. Please fix this - African news is important too. Itâ€™s not surprising there are so many people out there who are ignorant about Africa, when the premier news source with world-class writers, displays the news from the continent in such as a difficult to use manner. Please sort this out - itâ€™s frankly embarrassing that in 2020 this is still an issue. Also, you seem to have news blackouts on certain countries. I never saw a single thing about the Pakistan floods, and I have an Asian news flag in â€˜My Newsâ€™ but yet you report on floods in Philippines. The Armenian/Azerbaijan war took weeks to report. The Sudanese unrest in 2019 was also ignored.
