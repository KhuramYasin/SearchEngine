Shelby Thevenot Published on November 20th, 2021 at 08:00am EST Aa Accessibility Font Style Serif Sans Font Size A A Prince Edward Island held its scheduled immigration draw on November 18. The Prince Edward Island Provincial Nominee Program (PEI PNP) invited 188 immigration candidates to apply for a provincial nomination. Most of the invitations, 172, went to Express EntryÂ andÂ Labour Impact candidates. The remaining 16 invitations went to Business Impact candidates who had at least 67 points in the provinceâ€™s immigration system. Discover if Youâ€™re Eligible for Canadian Immigration PEI holds one Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) invitation round per month. The total number of invitations issued so far this year is now 1,729. PNPs allow Canadaâ€™s provinces and territories to select immigration candidates who meet their labour market needs. This is true of Prince Edward Island, which administers theÂ Prince Edward Island Provincial Nominee ProgramÂ (PEI PNP) within federally-approved guidelines. The next PEI PNP draw is expected for December 16, 2021. About the PEI PNP Express Entry Category TheÂ PEI PNPâ€™s Express Entry CategoryÂ is an enhanced PNP, which means it is linked with the federal governmentâ€™sÂ Express Entry system. In order to be considered for this stream, candidates need to have a profile in the system. Express Entry is an immigration application manager. It handles the applications for three economic-class immigration programs:Â Federal Skilled Worker Program,Â Federal Skilled Trades Program, andÂ Canadian Experience Class. Eligible candidates get aÂ Comprehensive Ranking SystemÂ (CRS) score for their age, work experience, education, and language proficiency in English or French. Express Entry candidates who receive a provincial nomination are given an additional 600 points toward their CRS score and are effectively guaranteed anÂ Invitation to ApplyÂ (ITA) for permanent residence in a subsequent Express Entry draw. In order to be considered for a provincial nomination from PEI, Express Entry candidates need to create an Expression of Interest (EOI) profile with the PEI PNP. EOI profiles are given points based on the provinceâ€™s unique points grid. The highest-scoring candidates are then invited to apply through monthly draws. Labour Impact Category The Labour Impact Category is for foreign nationals who have a valid job offer in PEI, and have support from their employer. It is divided into three streams: Skilled Worker,Â Critical Worker, andÂ International Graduate. Candidates in this category must also submit an Expression of Interest in order to be considered for a provincial nomination through the Labour Impact Category. Business Impact Category Business Impact Category candidates need to meet the minimum provincial score requirement in order to proceed with their applications. The score is different in every draw. The invitations that PEI sent in todayâ€™s draw were issued under the Work Permit Stream, which is for foreign entrepreneurs who want to own and operate a business on the island.
