Ernie Walker, Wanuskewinâ€™s chief archaeologist, made the rare discovery with the help of a bison herd. Last summer, Walker was out feeding the bison at the paddock â€” about 800 metres west of the Wanuskewin building. He looked down at the ground that the bison had been rolling around in and saw a boulder peeking through the dirt. Upon further investigation, Walker noticed the rock had grooves in a definite pattern and determined it was a petroglyph. â€œI was trying not to have a heart attack because I hadn't expected it,â€? Walker told reporters at the rock unveiling on Friday. Walker believes Indigenous people carved the rock more than a thousand years ago. The carving is known as â€œribstone,â€? Walker says it resembles the bones of a bison and represents fertility. Walker had surveyed the area in the 1980s and didnâ€™t find anything. He believes the bison, who were brought to the park in 2019, exposed the discovery. â€œThey uncovered it, just with their normal activity,â€? Walker says. â€œI like to think it's their message that theyâ€™re happy to be here.â€? Days after the ribstone discovery, Walker and his team found three more petroglyphs and the tool used to make the carvings. â€œThis is tremendously significant and very unusual,â€? Walker says. The archaeologist says the width of the carving rock matched the width of the grooves on the rock. He says itâ€™s rare to find the carving tool. â€œYou never get that,â€? he says. â€œWhoever did that, left it there or misplaced it, probably over a thousand years ago. I like to think it's their business card. They left their business card here.â€? The petroglyphs and carving tool are secured in glass, on display in the parkâ€™s building. Ernie Walker believes the bison, who were brought to the park in 2019, exposed the discovery. (Chad Hills/CTV News) DISCOVERY CARVING WAY FOR UNESCO DESIGNATION Wanuskewin is in the process of getting recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site. With this rare discovery, park CEO Darlene Brander says Wanuskewin is one step closer to reaching the designation. â€œItâ€™s significant and monumental,â€? Brander says. She says the petroglyphs were the missing puzzle piece in the UNESCO application. Wanuskewin aims to become a UNESCO World Heritage site by 2025.
