Brooklyn Nine-Nine Rewriting Season 8 Amid #BlackLivesMatter | Observer Search for: Submit Observer Arts | Entertainment | Business | Newsletters Arts Theater Visual Art Opera Dance Books Entertainment Movies TV Celebrity Lifestyle Business Technology Space Digital Media Startups Events Newsletters ‘Brooklyn 99’ Rewriting Season 8 Amid Protests Against Police Brutality By Brandon Katz • 06/24/20 1:24pm (l-r) Terry Crews as Terry Jeffords, Joe Lo Truglio as Charles Boyle in NBC’s Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Jordin Althaus/NBC The death of George Floyd has sparked global #BlackLivesMatter protests against police brutality and the pop culture realm is attempting to reconcile entertainment with reality. In the wake of the movement, bothÂ CopsÂ andÂ Live PDÂ were cancelled outright. Now, NBC sitcom Brooklyn Nine-NineÂ is attempting to revamp its portrayal of police to better reflect the national conversation. Co-star Terry Crews revealed that four planned episodes of Season 8 have been entirely scrapped as the writers want to re-contextualize the police workplace sitcom in light of recent events. That includes starting over with new scripts and receiving input from cast and crew. â€œWeâ€™ve had a lot of somber talks about it and deep conversations and we hope through this weâ€™re going to make something that will be truly groundbreaking this year. We have an opportunity and we plan to use it in the best way possible,â€? the actor told Access. â€œOur show-runner Dan Goor, they had four episodes all ready to go and they just threw them in the trash. We have to start over. Right now we donâ€™t know which direction itâ€™s going to go in.â€?

While no one expects a broadcast sitcom to deliver the definitive thesis on police brutality and racial inequality, it’s nice to see the creative team make the attempt at addressing the harsh truths facing this subject matter. Crews also discussed his own past experiences with police and how that has shaped his view of the current situation. â€œYouâ€™ve seen me, in movies or whatever but before all this, I was always a threat. I would be going to the mall or going different places. Iâ€™ve had guns pointed at me by police officers in L.A. This was before I was famous. The thing is, they had the wrong guy,â€? Crews said. â€œItâ€™s something that every black man has been through and itâ€™s hard to really try to get other people to understand. I have to say, right here, what is going on right now is Black Americaâ€™s Me Too movement. We always knew this was happening, but now white people are understanding.” Brooklyn Nine-NineÂ is currently on a production hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic.
