We can find evidence of past changes in the climate in: the growing and shrinking of ice caps and glaciers the fossils of plants and animals that changed as the climate changed the concentration of carbon dioxide in air that has been trapped in ice for thousands of years But recent studies by organisations such as the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) suggest that human activity has accelerated the rate of climate change. Climate change is mainly driven by the greenhouse effect which is caused by some gases in the atmosphere. Human activity has increased the concentration of these gases. Of these, carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚) produced by human activities is the largest contributor to global warming. Since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the 18th century, more and more carbon dioxide has been released into our atmosphere. Global average temperature between 1860 and 2000 to-topBack to top Responses to climate change Analysis by NASA scientists shows that the average global temperature has increased by just over 1Â°C since 1880. More than half the warming has happened since 1975. Governments and scientists from across the world are becoming increasingly worried about the impact of climate change as the Earth warms. Some countries are already experiencing wildfires, food shortages and extreme weather events. Countries are now being urged to reduce their use of fossil fuels and produce more clean energy from renewable sources such as: solar cells solar heating waves tides hydroelectric power geothermal energy to-topBack to top Watch: Green energy revolution video Watch this short clip to learn more about the green energy revolution. Video Transcript up down With the climate crisis becoming more real every day, you may be asking yourself what exactly we can do to fight back. The bad news is that thereâ€™s a lot of work to be done. The good news? Weâ€™re living through a green energy revolution. And things are being done. On several different levels. Alright, four. Firstly, thereâ€™s the international level. This is the big one. Since 1992, when climate change first began hitting the headlines, the United Nations has encouraged its member states to sign treaties aiming to reduce greenhouse gases and minimise climate change. Some of the UNâ€™s sustainable development goals are tackling the climate crisis head-on, cutting COâ‚‚ emissions, reducing the use of plastic, and making sure that cities and communities are â€“ yes! â€“ sustainable. International bodies like the European Union can also set emissions targets. However, itâ€™s up to individual countries to meet them. Thatâ€™s why so much work is done on a second, national level. For example, the UK intends to phase out traditional petrol and diesel cars and vans in future - greatly reducing travel emissions. And by 2050, the Welsh government has pledged that emissions will be offset. The vast majority of carbon emissions created here will be cancelled out with things like tree-planting schemes, bringing Wales closer to being a net-zero contributor to global warming. Thirdly, thereâ€™s the local level. Even your local council will have taken notice of climate change... even if they canâ€™t always make the buses run on time. Councils are responsible for recycling schemes. Yes, you may be using five different bins, but the planet thanks you. Honest. Small communities can take matters into their own hands. The Lammas Ecovillage in Pembrokeshire is self-reliant and climate-neutral. In other words, itâ€™s meeting the climate goals set by the government... just a few decades ahead of schedule. Religious groups and communities can also help. The idea that weâ€™re protectors of planet Earth is common to many religions. Groups like Humanists UK are also getting in on the fight against climate change - raising awareness and taking part in climate marches, for entirely non-religious reasons. And finally, thereâ€™s the individual level. That means you. Flying less, eating locally-sourced food, and using public transport can all help in the fight against climate change. But some are going above and beyond the call of duty. Welsh farmers are fighting back. Many are offsetting carbon emissions by making more organic produce, and some are even setting up hydroelectric schemes on their land. And of course, young people are shouldering more than their share of responsibility. Thanks to climate strikes, and the small things young people do every day, people are starting to talk. And act. On a local level, on a national level, up to the very top. Funny how these things work. to-topBack to top Green energy revolution strategies There are different strategies for tackling climate change. Many of these require taking a sustainable approach to the way we live our lives. Being sustainable means being able to meet our own needs without compromising those of future generations, by ensuring that there are enough resources available and that the Earth is kept habitable for the future. This can be done on four different levels: international national local individual International Over the years, several international agreements have been drawn up to combat climate change. The Kyoto Protocol which was agreed in 1997 was a commitment undertaken by 191 countries and the European Union to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases produced, especially carbon dioxide. It urged developed countries to reduce their COâ‚‚ emissions by more than other countries as they had been the primary contributors in the past. They were also encouraged to invest in new technology. The Paris Agreement signed in 2016 was the first of its kind in history This deal unites all the world's nations in a single agreement on tackling climate change. National In March 2021 Senedd Cymru approved a target of net zero emissions by 2050. This means balancing the greenhouse gas emissions with the amount of gases removed from the atmosphere. Several goals have been set to achieve this. 43,000 hectares of woodland must be planted by 2030, increasing to 180,000 hectares by 2050. This will play a vital part in removing COâ‚‚ from the atmosphere. The UK government has decided to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. They will invest Â£500 million in charging points for electric cars and fund research into battery technology. Local Councils have introduced recycling schemes. By recycling more, we can reduce the amount of new products that are needed, saving on the energy it would have required to create them. We can also reduce how much material is sent to landfill sites â€“ decomposing organic materials produce methane which is a potent greenhouse gas. Examples of sustainable projects include: bedZED (Beddington Zero Energy Developments) - a carbon neutral housing complex in Hackbridge, London Lammas Ecovillage - a village in Pembrokeshire with nine houses and a community hub which focuses on promoting a sustainable rural lifestyle Individual Making small changes to our own lives can also have an impact on climate change. Considering and adapting the foods we eat, the clothes we wear and the ways we travel can reduce the amount of greenhouse emissions produced. We consume foods from all over the world, such as bananas from Costa Rica and oranges from Spain. By buying more locally grown produce, we can reduce the amount of fossil fuels used to transport food. Being more conscious about how we travel can also have an impact on reducing greenhouse emissions. Travelling by car is much more polluting than walking, cycling and using public transport. Cutting down air travel would also have huge benefits. Researchers estimated that global aviation was responsible for emitting 1.04 billion tonnes of COâ‚‚ in 2018 â€“ which was 2.5 per cent of global COâ‚‚ emissions that year. to-topBack to top Environmental activism Friends of the Earth Cymru Friends of the Earth Cymru was established in 1984 with the goal of ensuring a sustainable future for Wales. They campaign on environmental issues and raise awareness of the impacts of climate change in Wales. Friends of the Earth Cymruâ€™s projects since its establishment include: campaigning to stop the building of unnecessary roads, such as a bypass through Snowdonia in the 1990s lobbying the Welsh Government which led to the setting of annual targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions and introduce an action plan following many recommendations made by them Greta Thunberg Many young people are now beginning to take a stand against the systems in place and demanding that countries act on climate change. The most famous is climate activist Greta Thunberg. She wants governments to act with more urgency in tackling harmful emissions. Her activism began in 2018 when she was 15 with a protest held outside the Swedish parliament with a sign that read "Skolstrejk fÃ¶r klimatet" ("School strike for climate"). She has inspired young people across the world to hold similar protests. In 2019 she sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to New York in order to attend the UN climate summit. She did so in a zero-emissions yacht to minimise the carbon footprint of her journey. She wanted to show the impact air travel has on climate change and that "the climate change crisis is a real thing".
