I call him my second when I talk to most people, but he’s my third. My second child died at 19 weeks and two days gestation and it is complicated to explain or for me to even understand. It is hard to say I “lost” a pregnancy because I didn’t lose him. I knew exactly where he was at all times. Rae Martens lost her child now more than six months ago, due to a rare disease. The Healthcare Waltz she describes is essential reading for parents navigating the system. At a Loss to Describe Loss In my case, the term miscarriage is technically correct. Although it’s more of a “late miscarriage,” since the term is most often used in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, but can be used up to 20 weeks of gestation. But when I tell people I had a miscarriage, I feel as though it doesn’t quite convey what happened. Because had I carried for just five more days, I’d reach 20 weeks — at which point it would have been labelled a stillbirth. All of these terms come with varying degrees of trauma. There’s pain, grief and it can often feel inconsolable. And I know I don’t represent all types of maternal loss, just mine. “My baby died because his pregnancy ended before he could have survived.” So when I honestly try to communicate my previous pregnancy in relation to my most recent, I find myself at a loss. The closest I’ve come to explaining it is, “My baby died because his pregnancy ended before he could have survived.” Honestly, it is painful to think about and to say. But I have accepted it. Rainbows Where There Are None I think it’s important to be aware of my loss, in order to understand what came next. In my case, what is commonly referred to as a “rainbow pregnancy.” But rainbows conjure delightful images — flashes of bright, vivid colour. Whereas for me, my experience could best be described as the anxiety and doom sometimes felt in the approach of a bad storm. While rainbow associations work for plenty of loss parents, all I can say is that they did not apply to mine. Life After Loss The further our family moves along in life, the more the sharp edges of my pregnancy loss — and the grief that followed — have softened. These rough-hewn edges won’t vanish, much like our second child will always be a part of me. Both have become etched into me, a reminder of the nuances of motherhood. No Loss is Identical As I moved slowly through grief, one fact always remained: every loss is unique. I am mindful that loss events continue to happen and they happen all too often. I feel an ache for the parents and parents-in-waiting who have suffered their own losses, or who are struggling with fertility challenges. To say I have empathy for the parents who have gone through loss without the healing grace of a healthy baby to hold is an understatement. My heart hurts for these parents in ways I still have trouble fully comprehending. Guilt In some cases, parents ascribe guilt to rainbow pregnancies. Often it's guilt for not being able to move past a lost baby. But if I feel guilt, it is for having had the sheer luck to have made it through the gauntlet of pregnancy this time. Make no mistake, I know this isn't a zero-sum game. I know that just because I was able to have a child, it doesn’t mean someone else can’t or won’t. But I have pangs of guilt anyway. "I know we were lucky, so I don’t take it for granted." So, out of respect and sensitivity to parents still walking a more uncertain path, I find myself navigating the world more reserved in how I display joy and relief. And inwardly I feel the same. I know we were lucky, so I don’t take it for granted. A Looming Threat During my third pregnancy, I came to terms with the idea that our baby might die. The constant thought of potentially going through another loss was the paradox of this pregnancy: to be both expecting, growing a person and observing the changes in my body, and accepting that until now the baby is alive, while at the same time making mental peace with the idea that he may or may not come to us. It was a practice in non-attachment. It’s also something a friend, who had experienced multiple pregnancy losses, dubbed “Schrödinger pregnancies.” Schrödinger Pregnancies The idea behind the term is linked to the thought experiment “Schrödinger’s Cat.” In the experiment, a hypothetical cat is considered simultaneously alive and dead, because its mortality is linked to a random, life-ending event that may or may not happen. The analogy seemed fitting to our pregnancy. Because the looming possibility of something bad happening was ever-present, baby preparation was different from our first. "I could not say with any certainty who I would become in the event of another loss." I’d stand in the diaper aisle, and at the time they represented a reality where a living, breathing person would come to us. It took probably four visits before I was able to walk out with a very small pack of infant diapers. These behaviours resulted from a very real sense of fear. I could not say with any certainty who I would become in the event of another loss. I knew I could likely handle it in time, but I also struggled with how awful it would be. During her last pregnancy, Sabrina Boileau had her own anxieties. She was having a "rainbow baby" during a pandemic, while her essential worker partner worked the front lines. Life Springs After all of the challenges, and the brain-twisting uncertainty, we had our planned C-section in a hurry, since our son arrived a few days early. Those first few days, relief filled my brain and my heart. There was our son, looking back at me. But while relief came, the anxiety was not as quick to make an exit. "He has transformed our grief into something beautiful and life with him is healing those sharp edges of grief." As each day passed safely, my brain slowly shifted from being on high alert to acceptance. Acceptance that, although we never take it for granted, the default state is safe, not dangerous. It’s joy, not grief. The most bittersweet part of this precious life we are now responsible for is that he would not exist without the brother who came before him. His joyful presence in our lives connects me to his brother we buried in ways I can’t quite explain. He has transformed our grief into something beautiful and life with him is healing those sharp edges of grief. For this, and for his life, I am grateful.
