The Chancellor was responding to a question in the Commons specifically about mothers who are working while dealing with childcare and home schooling responsibilities, although there was no mention of fathers in his answer. Speaking in the Commons, Conservative MP Joy Morrissey (Beaconsfield) said: â€œMany female business owners have found themselves working full-time jobs at home while bearing full-time responsibility for childcare and home schooling all at the same time. â€œMay I thank my right honourable friend for all the steps he is taking to alleviate the difficulties experienced by mothers who just want to work and contribute to the economy with their children safely back in school.â€? Labour's deputy leader slammed the Chancellor ( Image: PA) NHS chief says 'of course' there's a vaccine shortage and EU block would be a 'worry' No 10 and scientists slam 'baseless' claim in German media about AstraZeneca jab Mr Sunak replied: â€œMy honourable friend is absolutely right and we owe mums everywhere an enormous debt of thanks for doing the enormously difficult job of juggling childcare and work at this tricky time. â€œI know she will join me in being happy that early years settings have been open for a while. â€œBut sheâ€™s absolutely right, the only way to sustainably solve this challenge is to safely reopen our schools as quickly as we can.â€? Responding to the remark at Treasury questions, Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner wrote on Twitter : â€œErm @RishiSunak you know mums work too and donâ€™t just look after the kids and make meals..? â€œThatâ€™s why Labour is demanding flexible furlough for working parents balancing work with childcare and home schooling. â€œHappy to brief you on the inequality and sexism women face at work.â€?Most Read Don't Miss Follow Mirror FacebookTwitter Comment MORE ON ChildcarePolitics Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inbox Sign upInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.
