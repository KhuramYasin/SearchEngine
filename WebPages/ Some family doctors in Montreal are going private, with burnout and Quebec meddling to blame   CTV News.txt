Some family doctors in Montreal are going private, with burnout and Quebec meddling to blame | CTV News Home FOLLOW ON Advertisement MONTREAL Some family doctors in Montreal are going private, with burnout and Quebec meddling to blame Cindy Sherwin CTV News Montreal Videojournalist @CSherwinCTV Contact Published Monday, November 15, 2021 10:40AM EST Last Updated Monday, November 15, 2021 6:54PM EST Share: Reddit Share Text: MONTREAL -- The Quebec governmentâ€™s latest attempt at telling Montrealâ€™s family doctors they should be seeing more patients has landed with a thud, according to two general practitioners who said they are demoralized and tired of being micromanaged by the province. The mental fatigue is so great, one family doctor said he knows of two colleagues in the city who have recently decided to leave the public health care system permanently and work in private medicine. â€œWhat I hear on the ground is the burnout is palpable between physicians, between nurses, it is palpable,â€? said Dr. Mark Buch, 38, who runs a family medicine group (GMF) in Town of Mount-Royal and also works as a part-time emergency physician at the Jewish General Hospital.

After 11 years in practice, Buch has decided to stick it out in the public system but said he understands why two of his peers are opting out instead. â€œDoctors are so frustrated and fed up with the disrespect that some are saying, forget it, Iâ€™m done, and I'm delisting off of RAMQ, I'm going to go private,â€? he said. â€œAnd those physicians who go off RAMQ, I can tell you with 100 per cent certainty, they make less money than in the public system.â€? Buch said thatâ€™s because they can decide to see fewer patients per day allowing them to spend the time needed with each patient. â€œThey can practise medicine with dignity. And that is not the case right now,â€? he added. Roper, who is currently investing a lot of time and energy into fighting for a strong public health care system agrees. â€œIt takes a lot to succeed in a private practice,â€? he said. He also lamented that with so many Montreal residents doctor-less and in need of care â€œnowadays it is more possible to have a successful private practice, unfortunately.â€? The vast majority of GPâ€™s have not plunged into the private sector, but Buch said he does know some who are considering it or who are going to work at hospital-based practices or at private businesses to get away from the pressures of primary care. Taking early retirement is also now seen as a viable option, and may become a more palatable idea each time the government floats a new plan to change doctorsâ€™ workflow. In addition, there is the cohort of female family doctors, who are starting families of their own and are placed in a no-win situation, Buch said. â€œThis entire concept is very anti-feminine,â€? he said referring to the provinceâ€™s repeated theme that GPs donâ€™t work hard enough. Not all doctors can work six days a week as he usually does, he said, â€œbecause they have a family, they have to raise childrenâ€¦ that's their personal choice, and their right as a professional to do that.â€? â€œWe see the mass exodus of nurses from the healthcare system. I can foresee the same thing happening with family physicians,â€? said Buch. MORE DOCS NEEDED IN MONTREAL Does Montreal need more doctors? Roper, also the director of the primary care division at the McGill University Health Centre's (MUHC) department of family medicine, answers this question with a resounding, yes - though the health minister disagrees. The province sends doctors to regions that ostensibly need them through a permit system known as PREM --a regional physician resource plan. Roper would like to see the system suspended. The PREM plan for 2022 was released in October. In a few months, heâ€™ll be voicing his critique on the record. Aside from running a busy GMF, he has initiated a legal challenge against the government, with a first court date scheduled for Feb. 22. Whatâ€™s his main quarrel? Roper said he plans to argue that the government used flawed logic when it made its decision about how many doctors need to be allocated to each region to serve the local population. Roper said heâ€™s analyzed all the same health insurance board (RAMQ) data the health minister has access to --data which is publicly available. He concluded that it makes more sense to figure out how many doctors are needed in a certain area, based on how many residents don't have their own doctor yet, while health minister Christian Dube, â€œis looking at the number of doctors working in an area,â€? Roper said. Roper said that is a â€œflawed indicatorâ€? because it doesnâ€™t take into account who the doctorsâ€™ patients are - more precisely, where they live. He provided a few examples to bolster his argument, taking into account that the stated goal of the government is to register at least 85 per cent of the population in each territory. Some regions are doing well in that regard. The Bas-St-Laurent region has a patient registration rate of 89 per cent. The Gaspesie-Iles-de-la-Madelaine is at 90 per cent. â€œIn Montreal, weâ€™re at a 69 per cent registration rate overall,â€? Roper said, before zeroing in on a few areas to make his point about the doctor shortage: The Plateau Mont-Royal-St-Louis-du-Parc area of Montreal has only a 61 per cent patient registration rate. There are 68, 844 residents there who still need a family doctor. Next year the area is slated to receive 10 new GPs - however, itâ€™s expected to lose seven doctors to retirement, for a net gain of only three doctors. On the other hand, the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region, with a 92 per cent registration rate, and only 20,897 residents without a family doctor, is getting 17 new doctors, according to the PREM plan. With seven GPs expected to retire, thatâ€™s still a net gain of ten new doctors in the region. That doesn't make sense to Roper. â€œMy argument is that the distribution of PREMS is flawed,â€? he said. â€œThatâ€™s resulted in this disparity, inequality of access to a family doctor.â€? He also lays out the case and the need for more doctors in an area of Montreal called Cotes-des-Neiges-Metro-Parc-Extension, which includes the western part of the downtown core. Here, according to his calculation is the most â€œextremeâ€? example of what he called the governmentâ€™s flawed analysis that highlights a different issue entirely. That territory has a population of 252,334 people, 94,405 of whom are not registered with a family doctor. Roper said the health ministry claims there are enough doctors in the area, itâ€™s just that they arenâ€™t working hard enough to sign up new patients. "But the numbers on record show just the opposite," he said. "Doctors in the area have registered 270, 000 patients." "So how come they registered 270,000 patients and there are only 250,000 people living in the area and there are still 94,000 people in the area who are unregistered?â€? The answer he said, is that more than 50 per cent of the people who are signed up with a family doctor there live outside the region. They could be people who work in that part of the city or who used to live there, for example - but they don't reside there now. Meanwhile, current residents are crowded out. This is because of the concept of portability in Quebec, which means the right to seek health care wherever one chooses, is built into the province's health care system. "You canâ€™t take away portability of health care, but itâ€™s not even appearing on Mr. Dubeâ€™s radar," Roper concluded. His suggestion? â€œIf your [registration] target is 85 per cent and you want equity just throw all the doctors where youâ€™re below 85 per cent,â€? and revamp the system as we know it. The family physicianâ€™s arguments against the Quebec governmentâ€™s PREM system will be tested in court over two days starting on February 22. Constitutional and civil rights lawyer Julius Grey has taken on the case. . â€˜ONLY SO MANY HOURS IN THE DAYâ€™ Neither Roper nor Buch are optimistic Bill 11 will improve the system in any way. The proposed legislation tabled by Dube on Thursday appears to be an effort to temporarily appease doctors by holding off on imposing financial penalties or on fixing specific targets for the minimum number of patients per physician. Once again, it is being viewed largely as an example of government interference, that doesnâ€™t address the real problems. If the legislation passes, among other requirements, GPs would have to make appointment times available for people who are on the waiting list, likely some doctors said, at the expense of their patients. "I don't think any doctor has difficulty contributingâ€¦ but there are only so many hours in the day,â€? said Buch. "I think it's quite insulting to sort of make a broad statement that we don't work hard enough.â€? he said, referring to Premier Legaultâ€™s pronouncement in late October, an idea later propped up in the National Assembly by Dube. The accusation also rankles Roper, as someone who has been on the front lines of the doctor shortage battle in Montreal, with successive governments. "Itâ€™s galling to see the mismanagement of the medical manpower situation by the health ministries and then they blame the physicians for their own shortcomings," said the general practitioner. â€œA lot of these doctors are working in their private offices, working in long-term care institutions, in emergencies, exposing themselves to the COVID virus, and someone says, 'oh you only have 700 patients you should have 15 hundred.' No,â€? said Roper. For the first 15 years of their practice family doctors are assigned various other jobs by their local health authority, Buch explained. If they decline, they get a 30 per cent pay cut. â€œSo there is no such thing as a full-time family doctor for the first 15 years of practice. That's just the system that we're in,â€? said Buch. The assignments take them out of their offices from 6-12 hours per week. Each job comes with more paperwork and added responsibilities, he said. â€œContrary to what he [Dube] says, the doctors are working hard. He is just not measuring the right information,â€? said Roper.
