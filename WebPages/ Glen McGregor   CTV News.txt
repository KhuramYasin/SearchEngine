Based out of CTV Newsâ€™ Ottawa Bureau, McGregor contributes political coverage to CTV News across all platforms. An award-winning journalist, McGregor was previously National Affairs Reporter for the Ottawa Citizen, where he covered the federal government and politics on Parliament Hill, with a focus on ethics, lobbying, contracting practices, and election campaign finance. Throughout his career, McGregor has broken stories that led to the Canadian Senate expense scandal, the â€œRobocallsâ€? investigation, MP Dean Del Mastroâ€™s conviction, among many other stories to make national headlines. Specializing in data journalism, McGregor combines his expertise as an investigative journalist with multi-faceted computer science, statistics, and data mining techniques, which led him to win the Canadian Association of Journalists Award (CAJ) in Computer-Assisted Reporting in 2009, for co-authoring a series of stories analyzing political bias in the federal governmentâ€™s economic stimulus spending. An innovator in digital reporting, McGregor was the first journalist in Canada to live tweet from a courtroom, from one of Ottawaâ€™s most closely followed criminal trials involving the city's Mayor Larry Oâ€™Brien in 2009. In 2010, McGregor brought his computer-assisted reporting techniques to the classroom as Instructor, e-Publishing at Algonquin College, teaching data journalism and investigative reporting techniques. A regular commentator on federal politics on national radio and television, McGregor was named by the Hill Times as one of the 100 most-influential people in Canadian politics in 2012, 2013, and 2014. He speaks English and a bit of Mandarin Chinese.
