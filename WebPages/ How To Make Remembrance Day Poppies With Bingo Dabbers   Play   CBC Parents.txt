Perhaps you've got yours from last year, or maybe you're like many parents who sent a bunch off to school and never saw them again. They are slippery little flowers! Whatever the case, once you've got your poppy pins all set, I thought it would be a nice gesture to keep the conversation about Remembrance Day going with a fun activity. This craft isn't meant to replace your poppies, but more to create another opportunity to discuss the day and why it happens. And in the end, you'll have a boatload of unique poppies to collage with, hang or what have you. What You'll Need glue (I used transparent) a red bingo dabber (you can try other colours if your kids like to think outside the box) scissors card stock or any recycled paper (thicker is better, because if the paper is too thin it could get too saturated) poppy seeds (optional — if there is a poppy seed allergy in your home, skip this and use black paper, black felt or a sharpie) How It's Made First, have your little one grab a sheet of paper and a dabber. This is their blank canvas, so just give them this direction: make dots on the page. You can start by showing them an example and then they can cover the page. Set all of the sheets that have been dotted aside to dry. Once dry, it's time to free-hand cut a poppy shape. This can be for the adults, but if your kid has been practicing their cutting, try making a dotted-line version of the poppy on top of the finished sheet of dots and have them cut along it. That's looking pretty nice, folks. Next, it's time to grab your glue. Find the center of your poppy, and add a dime-sized blob of glue. This doesn't have to be perfect. Now is the fun bit. If your kids don't have a poppyseed allergy, give them the bowl or container to shake — or gently sprinkle — poppyseeds onto the glue. It will look something like this (or potentially messier, depending on how excited the kid is!) If you're not using poppyseeds, you can draw a circle with a black marker, or cut a circle out of black paper or felt and glue it down. The last step is to shake the excess seeds back into the bowl. Once that's done, a poppy has been finished! If you try your hand at this Remembrance Day activity, tag us on Instagram!
