ECCC meteorologist Terri Lang said the weather is normal for this time of year but there may be a change in the weather pattern. â€œSoil moisture for the farmers during fall was so dry but hopefully with the pattern changing weâ€™ll get some more moisture added in,â€? she said. While it is difficult to predict future forecasts, La Nina -- a cooler than normal sea-surface temperature in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean that impacts weather patterns globally -- generally brings colder than average temperatures and above-average precipitation. Last year, the province saw colder than average temperatures and below-average precipitation. â€œWe have been seeing different weather patterns over the years and it depends a lot on whatâ€™s going on throughout globally,â€? said Lang. Lang said over the years, the province has been running on a very dry pattern and that the moisture is needed. â€œWe know El Ninoâ€™s tend to bring dry and warm winters, while El Nina is generally colder and snowy, although we havenâ€™t seen any big snow [in] winter lately,â€? said Lang. Lang said residents should take precautions throughout weather similar to this by ensuring that they have their winter tires, an emergency kit in the car, and have all their snow gear ready for winter driving. â€œSometimes we get lulled into that sense of complacency, especially when its been so nice. We know its going to snow, we know its going to get cold, we know its going to be windy so we may as well get prepared for it,â€? she said.
