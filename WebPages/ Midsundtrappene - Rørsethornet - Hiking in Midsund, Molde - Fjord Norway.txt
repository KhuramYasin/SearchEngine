The walk up to Rørsethornet is 659 meters above sea level. It will make your heart beat raise and might take your breath away if you are afraid of heights. But after getting to the top, you will have the most amazing 360-degree view. You will see the ocean, as well as the fjord and other mountains. The sunset from Rørsethornet is also worth the experience, as well as the sunrise. Along the stairs you will find picnic areas and viewpoints, one of them is Sherpanakken. You can also walk from Rørsethornet to Ræstadhornet. The path is marked and there is a spacious parking lot at the end of the stairway in Råkvåg. Park by RV RV668 un Rakvåg at the north side of the Island, and follow the signposted stone path from there. It is an open ridge from Rørsethornet (659 m.a.s) over to Ræstadhornet. Book a bus ticket from Molde, check timetable and prices here. The view is stunning! Duration 2,5 + 1,5 = 4h.
