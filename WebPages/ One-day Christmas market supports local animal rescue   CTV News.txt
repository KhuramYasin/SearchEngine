More than 100 local vendors took part in the market selling everything from jewellery, kitchen items, Christmas decorations, soaps, perfumes, and food products. â€œWe have something for everyone,â€? Cathy Malcom, SCARS vendor coordinator, told CTV News Edmonton. The volunteer-run event saw more than 1,000 Edmontonians shop and support the animal rescue agency. â€œAll the vendors have paid a table fee to be part of the event and all the money goes towards SCARS,â€? Malcom added. â€œSo itâ€™s a big, big fundraiser for us. â€œOur vendors are incredibly happy that they are able to be at this location in-person and be able to interact with their customers.â€? Vendors also donated items for an online charity auction that will launch tomorrow.
