The Elks were only able to must three lonely wins this year â€“ their lowest total in almost 60 years. â€œWould this be accepted again? Certainly, I wouldnâ€™t expect that at all,â€? said Brock Sunderland, Elks general manager. â€œWe arenâ€™t planning on that.â€? While the season may be over for the Canadian Football League team, head coach Jaime Elizondo said the team has work to do during the off-season. â€œWe are just getting a chance here over the next couple of months to lay some of our foundation down, some of our core beliefs and really implement them as opposed to just throwing them on a sheet of paper and talk about them briefly,â€? Elizondo said. â€œThereâ€™s a big, big difference.â€? â€œThe process is starting to correct what we can and do what we can to make sure that this doesnâ€™t ever happen again,â€? Sunderland. Elks brace for brutal finish to a season to forget amid struggle for wins, fans Equipment manager for Edmonton football team let go in 49th year with team 'I made a mistake': Former Elks player who misrepresented vaccine status apologizes Elks radio analyst fired for remarks on team's general manager Edmonton failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 2018, and the lack of wins drove fans away in record numbers. Only two of the seven home games managed to register more than 30,000 in attendance at Commonwealth. â€œIâ€™ve been here when the average (attendance) was in the 30,000s,â€? said Matt Oâ€™Donnell, veteran Elks lineman. â€œSo I know what it takes, and I know how it feels. â€œIt definitely can change a game for guys, whether it gets guys hyped extra or gets that mojo flowing,â€? he added. â€œBut thatâ€™s on us to bring â€˜em back. Thatâ€™s not on them to be like, oh, we owe it to you. Itâ€™s we (who) owe it to them.â€? â€œThe fans in this city have come to expect championships and winners, and our job is to deliver championships and wins,â€? Elizondo said, adding that anything less is a failure for the team. â€œWe certainly want to have the reverse of this record at this time next year,â€? Sunderland said. The team has six months to figure it all out until the next season begins.
