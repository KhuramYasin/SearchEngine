Reconciliation top of mind as Montreal welcomes most diverse city council to date | CTV News Home FOLLOW ON Advertisement MONTREAL Reconciliation top of mind as Montreal welcomes most diverse city council to date Iman Kassam CTV News Montreal Videojournalist @ImanKassam Contact Published Thursday, November 18, 2021 10:07AM EST Last Updated Thursday, November 18, 2021 2:53PM EST Share: Reddit Share Text: MONTREAL -- Dominique Ollivier is about to become the second most powerful elected official in Montreal. The Haitian-born Montrealer has just been named president of the city's executive committee. â€œIâ€™m up for the challenge,â€? she declared. â€œIf you want to diversify your workforce, you should start at the top.â€? Ollivier is the first Black woman ever to be given the honour, but what excites her most aren't her own achievements -- it's the fact that she won't be alone. This city council is the most diverse that Montreal has ever seen. â€œWeâ€™re going to be tackling power struggles. Weâ€™re going to be tackling privileges. Weâ€™re going to be tackling lots of issues," she said. "And hoping that, by not being only one person carrying that burden, the conversation is going to go more smoothly.â€? With 30 years of experience in project and organizational management, Ollivier boasts a degree in engineering and a Master's degree in public administration from the École Nationale d'Administration Publique. WATCH LIVE AT 6PM: Montreal mayor swearing-in ceremony She says when she learned that another Inuit homeless person had died in the cold, she committed herself to making sure there is a permanent solution for the Raphael Andre Memorial Tent, a warming station that protects up to 300 homeless people a day in Cabot Square. â€œYou have a lot of people who are ready to take action, and I think thatâ€™s the combination of both the political will and the availability of candidates and their willingness to go forward and risk it all,â€? she said. "Weâ€™re talking about the future of Montreal. Weâ€™re not talking about being Black, weâ€™re not talking about being discriminated, weâ€™re talking about our visions for Montreal.â€? The city councillor for Vieux-Rosemont in Rosemontâ€“La Petite-Patrie insists she wants all her decisions to be made with cultural sensitivity. â€œYou need to empower them, you need to help them, it canâ€™t just be a one model fits all,â€? she pointed out. It's a similar aspiration that drove Alia Hassan-Cournol -- the first Arab woman elected to council -- to politics. â€œAs an immigrant who arrived on Mohawk territory in Tiohtià:ke I feel I have a responsibility to help,â€? she said. â€œWe will be able to make decisions that are not only made for the elite, but for marginalized people. For the single mom, for the Black person always being scared of racial profiling, for homeless people, for young students, for immigrants... Weâ€™re going to make decisions that affect the most marginalized.â€? French-Egyptian by birth, Hassan-Cournol moved to Quebec in the late 2000s. As a political scientist, she specializes in immigration and public policy issues, most notably with organizations that defend the rights of girls, women of diversity and Indigenous women. â€œWe make decisions that I think are more inclusive in the sense that we feel the people," she said. "We have that almost physical sense of what people are going through. Everybody on council, whatever the party is, is ready to fight systemic racism.â€? The city councillor for Maisonneuve-Longue-Pointe in the borough of Mercierâ€“Hochelaga-Maisonneuve adds centring decisions and services around the needs of the most marginalized are the only way to level the playing field. â€œWeâ€™re going to have decisions that affect marginalized people, that are good for them, but by ripple effect are good for everybody, you know?" she said. "Put the marginalized person at the centre. This is intersectionality and thatâ€™s exactly what I want to bring to council -- and it is time to do it.â€? Hassan-Cournol notes it's about time City Council was more diverse. â€œItâ€™s a message of hope. Itâ€™s a message of inclusion and itâ€™s what makes Montreal a great city," she said. â€œPolitics has always been for the same people, but it was time for politics to enter the communities -- and mostly for the communities to enter politics.â€? Ollivier adds what is truly great is this power to break the glass ceiling. â€œWeâ€™re going to get a lot of new voices that will be given the means of realizing the city theyâ€™re dreaming of and for me, thatâ€™s really powerful,â€? she said.
