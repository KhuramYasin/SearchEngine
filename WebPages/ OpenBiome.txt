What we do We work with clinicians to make Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) easier, safer, and more widely available. We do so by providing hospitals with screened, frozen material ready for clinical use. This service eliminates the time, staff, protocols, and facilities needed to screen and prepare material from new donors for each treatment. Find Out How → Why we're here We founded OpenBiome, a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, after watching a friend and family member suffer through 18 months of C. difficile and 7 rounds of vancomycin before finally receiving a successful, life-changing FMT. The remarkable efficacy of this treatment and the great lengths required to receive it convinced us that we needed to help expand access.
