But when something goes awry in the city, these special kids, filled with curiosity and a sense of justice, get ready for their mission — but they have to wait until nightfall when the city is asleep so they can go un detected. Instead of going to bed like all the other children, when our heroes get their pyjamas on, they magically transform into super heroes and become the PJ Masks. Here come Catboy — super fast and agile; Gekko — super strong and can scale walls; and Owlette – with the ability to fly and see great distances. Together these three can tackle any situation! PJ Masks — they’re on their way into the night to save the day! PJ Masks is based on French author Romuald Racioppo’s imaginative and striking picture book series ‘Les Pyjamasques’. A beloved publishing property in its native France, where books debuted in 2008, 15 titles have been published in the country to date with plans to release two new titles every year. Kids can play PJ Masks: Hidden Heroes — a matching memory game — on the CBC Kids website. Note that PJ Masks is not currently available for online viewing on CBC Kids platforms.
