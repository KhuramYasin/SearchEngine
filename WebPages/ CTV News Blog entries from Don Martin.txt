OPINION Don Martin: The friendly face of Erin O'Toole's worst nightmare The friendliest MP has become Erin O'Toole's deadliest foe as Marilyn Gladu steps forward as the personification of internal caucus sympathy, if not support, for anti-vaccination forces, Don Martin writes in an exclusive column for CTVNews.ca. OPINION Don Martin: Does Trudeau love all of Canada? That's a good question now. Prime Minister Justin Trudeauâ€™s single-minded takedown of oilsands production is like banning Christmas tree sales so he can start delivering on his three-year-old pledge to expand our forests by two billion trees, a promise that has yet to take root, Don Martin writes in an exclusive column for CTVNews.ca. OPINION Don Martin: The good, bad and ugly of the new Trudeau cabinet The over-arching theme of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's new cabinet is how this gaggle of ministers is more lapdog than usual, where a long, loyal, sycophantic friendship to the prime minister appears to be THE critical consideration for a ticket to The Show, Don Martin writes in an exclusive column for CTVNews.ca. OPINION Don Martin: At 24 post-election days and counting, the federal government is still in limbo Prime Minister Justin Trudeauâ€™s canâ€™t-delay campaign for historic change has produced a sloth-speed government with a cabinet yet to be named, an idled bureaucracy waiting for orders and no date for Parliamentâ€™s return in sight, Don Martin writes in an exclusive column for CTVNews.ca. OPINION Don Martin: On a national day of Indigenous reflection, the prime minister sees only his own Justin Trudeau's behaviour on what should have been a solemn day of healing cannot be reconciled with conduct becoming of Canada's prime minister, Don Martin writes in his exclusive column for CTVNews.ca. OPINION Don Martin: Jason Kenney's political fate is in the ICU - and failing fast Alberta Premier Jason Kenney is confronting a full-throated justification for a pink slip thanks to his chronic tone-deafness during the pandemic, incredulously topped off by taking a two-week vacation in Europe this month as Albertans were dying from the consequences of his policies, writes Don Martin in his exclusive column for CTVNews.ca. OPINION Don Martin: Sooner or later in this status quo mandate, Justin Trudeau will take his walk in the snow It might take a year or longer before it becomes clear to him, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will eventually realize heâ€™s finished, Don Martin writes in his exclusive column for CTVNews.ca. OPINION Don Martin: Trudeau lost the debate, but the voters may not notice -- or care Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau lost, but didnâ€™t face the sort of devastating smackdown which would end his prime ministerial prospects, Don Martin writes in his exclusive column for CTVNews.ca. OPINION Don Martin: It's all about him -- and that's why Trudeau is in trouble Three weeks after Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau started the victory lap for his vaccination procurement success, the Liberal party is flirting with a future in the Official Opposition â€“ and itâ€™s very much all because of him, Don Martin writes in his exclusive column for CTVNews.ca. OPINION Don Martin: Liberal majority hopes melting away, but far too early for Conservative giddiness If Justin Trudeau's leadership wobble continues to worsen for another few weeks, the Conservatives may have the right to get giddy about governing, Don Martin writes in his exclusive column for CTVNews.ca. Don Martin: The Liberal and Conservative campaigns limp out of the starting gate The Sept. 20 federal election is not necessary, has no coherent rationale to justify Liberal Leader Justin Trudeauâ€™s $500-million bid for a majority mandate and, worst of all, puts the federal government on hold at the precise moment when a fourth COVID-19 wave will hit the youngest the hardest, Don Martin writes in his exclusive column for CTVNews.ca. Don Martin: A warning for Justin Trudeau as he ponders an early election about nothing The prime minister aims to call an election this summer and coast to a majority mandate on post-vaccination euphoria, says Don Martin in his exclusive column for CTVNews.ca. But that victory march might hit a nasty speedbump if voters believe theyâ€™re being dragged to the polls by a government using false pretenses. Don Martin: Without a quick resolution to their leadership crisis, the Greens will fade away The threatened reign of successor Annamie Paul is the most bizarre, messy and unfortunate political drama among many raging on Parliament Hill as MPs prepare for what sounds like an election campaign launch in late summer, Don Martin writes in his exclusive column for CTVNews.ca. Don Martin: Teflon Trudeau dodges trouble with a gift from the Greens Having Fredericton MP Jenica Atwin quit the Greens over Middle East political differences helped change the channel on a bad news day for the Liberal government, Don Martin writes in his latest column for CTVNews.ca. Don Martin: How to win the next election: It's the reopening, stupid. Many Canadian politicians are oh-so-deserving of an electoral spanking for actions that introduced, spread, slowed and then revived COVID-19 across the country, writes Don Martin in his exclusive column for CTVNews.ca, adding that with the third wave becoming a ripple, a road back to popularity and power has opened up for incumbent political leaders. Don Martin: Sorry is never the hardest word for Justin Trudeau Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should focus his apologies on current political mistakes, writes Don Martin in his exclusive column for CTVNews.ca. Don Martin: Vaccination-leading Canada is finally shedding fear factors for hope For far too long in this pandemic, the light at the end of the tunnel was an oncoming train wreck. Today, thereâ€™s reason to hope that the light is actually a way out of the darkness, writes Don Martin in his exclusive column for CTVNews.ca. Don Martin: Vaccine hesitancy spreads as provinces hit the AstraZeneca pause button The current cross-Canada blast of anti-AstraZeneca messaging borders on fearmongering and boosts the fear factor in those wavering with vaccine hesitancy, writes Don Martin in his exclusive column for CTVNews.ca. Don Martin: Being Jason Kenney is the worst job in politics today Spare some pity for Alberta Premier Jason Kenney as he tries to straddle two marching bands of public opinion, which are on a nasty collision course over his handling of the pandemic, writes Don Martin in his exclusive column for CTVNews.ca.
