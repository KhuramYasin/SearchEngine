Having a voice and being able to use it is a privilege and a gift. It gives us the opportunity to influence the world around us and a way to express our beliefs. We all have the right to speak up for the change we want to see and what we want our future to look like â€“ especially when it comes to climate change. Throughout history, young people have played a key role in bringing about change by voicing their concerns. Greta Thunberg was 15 years old when she started protesting outside the Swedish parliament in 2018. Sisters Melati and Isabel Wijsen from Indonesia were 12 and 10 years old when they asked the Bali government to ban single-use plastic bags from the island (spoiler alert: they succeeded). to-topBack to top Not sure where to start? Here's how to make your voice heard. Hear from a group of young people about their experiences and some tips for you to get going. to-topBack to top Start small If youâ€™re not used to being vocal about your opinions, start small. You can practice by speaking up more at home or school. The first step can be as simple as understanding why you want to start speaking up, or figuring out what topic you want to focus on â€“ for example, climate justice, sustainable fashion, or plastic pollution. We all have different experiences, so your voice is unique to you. 19-year-old Amy Bray, who founded the environmental charity Another Way, started her journey at home by getting her family to reduce their plastic use. to-topBack to top Keep going The only way to build your confidence is to keep trying. When it feels impossible to get going, keep reminding yourself â€“ what made you want to do this in the first place? Use that as a motivation and stay hopeful. For Charlotte Boggon, a Young Trustee of YPTE (Young People's Trust for the Environment), what keeps her going is knowing there are other confident young people out there who are speaking up. She also says, â€œYoung people still arenâ€™t represented enough in these kind of places where decisions are being made â€“ like government and businesses.â€? to-topBack to top Mistakes are inevitable Things might go wrong at some point, but thatâ€™s okay. It happens more often than you think and itâ€™s a brilliant opportunity to learn and improve. Why not keep a journal about your experience so you can record your wins and setbacks to help you see how far youâ€™ve come? to-topBack to top Grow your voice A good way to grow your voice is to share your knowledge with others and encourage them to speak up. You can also explore how to make it easier for others to replicate what youâ€™ve done, so they donâ€™t have to start from scratch. Zaqiya Cajee, 18-year-old founder of SwopItUp, started running clothes swap events at her school then decided to turn it into an organisation, to help students from other schools run their own clothes-swapping events. Zoe, a 16-year-old who attended a Bright Green Future training programme for budding environmentalists, suggests chatting to others at school. Look for opportunities to get other students to learn about the topic or problem and offer different ways to deliver your message (e.g. games, poems, presentation slides). to-topBack to top Youâ€™re not alone There are countless others who are in the same boat as you, even if you sometimes feel lonely in your effort to create change. You may find it helpful to connect with other young people who are trying to achieve the same goals as you. See if you can join an online youth or environmental group to build a support network. There is no one right way of doing this. Using your voice to make a difference is not about being popular or having thousands of followers on social media â€“ itâ€™s about openly sharing your ideas and thoughts in the hope that at least one person is moved to take action. If we all have this effect on others, imagine what we can achieve together. to-topBack to top Make a difference Discover more about the planet and how to protect it with the BBC.
