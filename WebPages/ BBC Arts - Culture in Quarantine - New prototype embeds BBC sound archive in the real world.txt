The Sonosynthesiser is an exciting prototype that explores how forgotten sound recordings can be embedded in physical space, allowing users to explore a unique audio history.

"An amazing, time-travelling collection of sounds" Emily Sorrell was inspired to build the Sonosynthesiser the moment she discovered the BBC sound archive online. "I had come across it when it was first made publicly available and I couldn’t believe that more people weren’t talking about it" she said. From a marriage in Mumbai, to bird calls in the Blue Mountains, you can explore echoes of worlds which may no longer even exist Emily Sorrell Having studied as a graphic designer, Sorrell soon became fascinated with design thinking in three dimensional spaces. She now works as a creative strategist and innovation designer, collaborating with heritage collections and cultural organisations across the UK, exploring ways to preserve intangible heritage collections and highlight opportunities for creative innovation as we reimagine our museums and cultural spaces. Her first major work, The Sonosynthesiser, creates a layer of archive sound on top of a physical environment. Users can locate and tune into different fragments of sound using a hand-held device. "I wanted to use digital technology to build an experience that was tactile, and felt authentically analogue - something retro-futurisic,” Sorrell explained. "I wanted familiar technology to feel invisible, like magic." With no background in technology, Sorrell worked to build a specialised team to bring the concept to life. “Software engineer, Eddie Reeder was the resident magician” Sorrell says, “But we also worked with three very talented emerging designers to build something that felt right for the concept. We ended up with a beautiful atomic-era inspired prototype that you can’t help but pick up and start engaging with." The three designers in question are Lydia Otway, Toby Michael Shepherd and Hattie Evans. Throughout the project, the software and physical device went through iterative testing and improvement, as the team explored how to make the experience intuitive enough that people could get lost in it. One of the highlights of the project was seeing the emotional responses of the first users, particularly older members of the public who were visibly moved when listening to the bygone sounds that once permeated their everyday lives. Users described the experience as 'beautiful, fascinating and very hypnotic'. Though the first iteration of the Sonosynthesiser draws on the vast BBC Sound Effects Archive, the tool could easily become a vessel for other forgotten collections, allowing people to physically immerse themselves in any digital archive. Whether it's audio or video-based, the possibilities are practically endless. Sorrell hopes she can test other applications for the prototype in the future; “This time-travelling device,” she adds “has infinite potential in E-health as an immersive companion to patients with early to mid-stage dementia. It would be such a privilege to explore this further.” Find out more See and hear the Sonosynthesiser in action This short film reveals how the Sonosynthesiser works.
