Stavanger is the region’s largest city with a population of around 130 000. Urban nature break ™ Restaurants and ingredients in this parts of Norway have received excellent reviews from both national food critics, as well as from the Michelin guide, where Stavanger became the first Norwegian city, except for the capital, to have this highly sought after Michelin star in 2016.
