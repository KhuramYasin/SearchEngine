Gourmet Plateau eatery slammed for advertising minimum wage cooking job | CTV News Home FOLLOW ON Advertisement MONTREAL Gourmet Plateau eatery slammed for advertising minimum wage cooking job Billy Shields CTV News Montreal Videojournalist @billyshields Contact Published Saturday, November 20, 2021 9:24PM EST Last Updated Sunday, November 21, 2021 4:39PM EST Share: Reddit Share Text: MONTREAL -- A Five Guys in downtown is offering $15 an hour plus a bonus to flip burgers. Not to be outdone, a McDonaldâ€™s in Blainville is offering $17.50 plus a signing bonus for lineworkers on the night shift. So when Au Pied de Cochon â€“ about as famous a high-end restaurant as exists in Montreal â€“ advertised a position as a cook starting at $13.50 an hour, the reaction on social media was severe. â€œCertainly a good reason, and not the only one, of a labour shortage in restaurants,â€? one commenter wrote. â€œWhatâ€™s up le pied? #wack.â€? Billy Gogas, who runs the Restaurant Lafayette casse-croute in the Village, reacted by saying â€œThis guy wants people to work for $13.50 an hour? Yeah good luck!â€? David Ferguson is a restaurant industry veteran who runs the high-end Restaurant Gus, a cozy bistro in the Plateau. He told CTV News that many people started leaving the industry years ago, and that the pandemic just accelerated and exposed a wage structure that wasnâ€™t keeping up. On the help-wanted ad, he said: â€œItâ€™s not just that one restaurant is doing it. Itâ€™s that itâ€™s a bad image for all of us. It makes it look like weâ€™re not serious about taking care of our staff.â€? Martin Picard, Au Pied de Cochonâ€™s owner, pointed out to French media outlets that the listing wage was a starting point, it wasnâ€™t necessarily the actual starting salary. â€œIt was the starting offer but after they chose which employees they will have, there will be a discussion and they will be offering wages higher than the minimum wage,â€? said Martin Vezina, a spokesperson for the Quebec Restaurant Association. Another point some in the restaurant industry make is that at some restaurants employ a tipping system for the kitchen by pooling tips on something known as the points system. But thatâ€™s up to the restaurant and its staff to implement and it isnâ€™t done in a universal way. Most tend to agree that in the short term, the cost of a restaurant meal is going to go up as wages adjust to the new normal. But in the long term, the labour shortage could mean that owning and operating a high-end restaurant in Montreal is no longer something that many budding restaurant workers dream of. â€œI think a lot of people have to start processing the idea that, if we have an extreme shortage of cooks now,â€? Ferguson said. â€œAnd that means five years from now we're going to have an extreme shortage of chefs.â€?
