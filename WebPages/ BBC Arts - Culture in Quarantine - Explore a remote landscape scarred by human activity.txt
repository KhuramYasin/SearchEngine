Her latest piece, Conniveo, provides a poignant glimpse of a landscape far from civilisation but still scarred by human activity. From audiences to active participants For Georgia Tucker, new technology can be a vital tool to raise awareness of environmental concerns. Her latest project, Conniveo, explores the growing problem of marine pollution; particularly the threat from plastics and oil, and the growth of dead zones in which little marine life can survive. There are no islands on Earth left untarnished by human pollution. We have turned the ocean into a dumping ground. Georgia Tucker Viewers are transported to an uninhabited island, far from anyone else on Earth, and are free to explore. However, the landscape is a long way from being a paradise. Submerging themselves in the vibrant ocean, viewers notice a fishing net which forms a pathway between themselves and a polluted world. It is their choice whether they follow to see the consequences of human activity, or remain behind the façade of beauty. For Georgia, the opportunities offered by new interactive technologies are crucial to her artistic practice. Her work relies on a collaboration with the viewer, as they turn from being a passive audience into active participants. By providing her users with space to navigate, she offers them unique, individual experiences - a reflection of how we navigate literally and morally in the real world. Conniveo was inspired by the real life Henderson Island - an uninhabited island in the South Pacific that was recently found to have one of the highest densities of plastic pollution anywhere in the world.
