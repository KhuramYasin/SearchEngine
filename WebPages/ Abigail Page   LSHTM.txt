I completed my PhD in Biological Anthropology in 2016, specialising in the cooperative childrearing, health and reproduction of a hunter-gatherer population in the Philippines called the Agta. Since my PhD, I have become increasingly interested in social support and it's consequences for maternal and child health more broadly. To explore these topics further, I joined the LSHTM in 2018 to bring together evolutionary, public health and demographic research on social support and maternal and child outcomes. At the LSHTM I am an active member of the Population Studies Group within the Department of Population Health, as well as theÂ Evolutionary Demography GroupÂ run by Rebecca Sear. I am also a member of MARCH, particularly interested in ECD and how this is impacted by childrearing experiences. Share Affiliations Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health Department of Population Health Centres Centre for Maternal Adolescent Reproductive & Child Health (MARCH) Teaching I currently teach on both the intensive online (face-to-face) and distance learning MSc in Demography and Health. I am engaged in teaching in Analyzing Survery and Population Data, Population Studies, Population, Povety and Enviornment and Contemporary Demographic Trends and Issues. Â Research During my PhD and postdoc on the Hunter-Gatherers Resilience Project (PI Andrea Migliano) I worked on understanding the relationship between the settlement, health and fertility. Despite many development policies focusing on the settlement of mobile populations, like hunter-gatherers, the evidence suggests this is frequently not in the populations best interests. I have also focused on research on understanding who helps mothers with young children, why they offer this help, and the consequences this has for maternal workload. With colleagues and MSc students at the LSHTM we are currently exploring how childcare varies between the mobile and settled households, representing different ways of buffering risk, and the consequences of childcare for childrenâ€™s nutritional outcomes in critical developmental periods. Â I recently wrote a blog about my research on childcare in the Agta: https://socialsciences.nature.com/users/268921-abigail-e-page/posts/51985-when-is-childcare-really-childcare Â My work on childcare for mothers in the Agta, and its consequences for maternal and child outcomes, has led me to be increasingly interested in different disciplines approaches to social support. As part of my research as a MRC Research Fellow (which I started in 2018) at the LSHTM, I have been working with colleagues from UCL on several projects looking at social support and infant feeding in UK mothers, both prior and during the COVID-19 pandemic. These projects specifically explores social support for new mothers from a wide range of individuals, such as partners, extended family, friends as well as health care professionals and peer supporters. Key outcomes in breastfeeding duration, maternal experience of infant feeding and the experience of breastfeeding problems. The experience of working on social support from different perspectives, including anthropology, demography and public health, has accumulated in a special issue of Phil Trans B, guest edited by myself, Dr Emily Emmott and Dr Sarah Myers: â€œMultidisciplinary perspectives on social support and maternal-child healthâ€?. In addition to my work on social support I am also running a large cross-cultural study with Rebecca Sear on the relationship between fertility and subsistence strategy for small-scale populations. This is a collaboration of 25 researchers who have demographic and subsistence data on populations from around the world. Here, the aim is simply to explore to what degree fertility is influenced by different modes of subsistence, such as foraging, horticultural, pastoralism and agriculture.
