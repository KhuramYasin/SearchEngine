Social Sharing From wealth taxes to a more robust CRA, the top parties have different plans to revamp Canada's tax system Nick Boisvert Â· CBC News Â· Posted: Sep 16, 2021 4:00 AM ET | Last Updated: October 4 NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has made taxing the households he calls 'ultra-rich' a central promise of his election campaign. (Evan Mitsui/CBC) comments The federal NDP and Conservatives typicallyÂ don't agree on much, but they have aligned on at least one topic this election campaign: making sure Canada's wealthiest "pay their fair share." You can find that line in the Conservatives' 2021 platform. (Download the plan and scroll down to page 157) And of course, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has talked about making the wealthy "pay their fair share" at just about every available opportunity. Here's what we know about the personal taxationÂ plans for each of the major federal parties, and who exactly they're talking about when they mentionÂ the "ultra-rich" or "the top one per cent of earners." New Democratic Party While each of the major parties wants to make changes to Canada's tax rules, the NDPÂ has proposed the most radical overhaul ofÂ the existing system. The central promise is a new annual wealth tax of one per cent on every dollar a family possessesÂ aboveÂ $10 million. A family with a net wealth of $100 million, for example, would pay $900,000Â in annual taxes under this plan, in addition to various other taxes already in place. The Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO), which provides fiscal analysis of various campaign promises, has said the NDP plan would generate slightly more than $60 billion over the next five years. But the PBO also says a "behavioral response" should be expected as some wealthy Canadians try to avoid the tax. The NDPÂ also wouldÂ increase Canada's top marginal tax rate â€” on annual income over $216,000 â€” from 33 per cent to 35 per cent. An NDP governmentÂ would increase the capital gains inclusion rate from 50 per cent to 75 per cent. This change would increase the amount of taxes Canadians have to pay when they make a profit on things like stocks, bonds or property. PARTY PLATFORMSCompare party platforms on top election issues Singh said changes like these will make life more affordable for the vast majority of Canadians. "One of my friends was like, 'Are you going after the folks with the two-car garage and a Peloton?'" Singh said in an interview with CBC's chief political correspondent Rosemary Barton. "I'm like, 'No, that's not you.'" Liberals The Liberal platform notes that the party already has raised taxes on the "top one per cent of earners."Â The Liberal platform notes that the party already has raised taxes on the "top one per cent of earners"Â by creating a new higher tax bracket, currently set for income above $216,511.Â (According to Statistics Canada, in 2018, the most recent year for which figures are available, the top 1 per centÂ of tax filers were those earning more than $244,800 in annual income.) The Liberals' 2021 promises are mainly designed to ensure that wealthy Canadians actually pay their taxes. The party is proposing a new minimum tax rate of at least 15 per cent for people in Canada's top tax bracket, who can sometimes reduce their tax rate through deductions and credits. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) headquarters in Ottawa. Each of the main federal parties, except the People's Party of Canada, say they'll boost funding to help the agency identify tax cheats. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press) The PBO estimates a 15 per cent minimum would generate $1.7 billion over the next five years. The Liberals alsoÂ wouldÂ increase funding to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) by $1 billion annually to help the agency fight back against "aggressive tax planning and tax avoidance." Conservatives The Conservative platform focuses almost entirely on large corporationsÂ â€”Â more specificallyÂ foreign multinationals and big tech companies. The platform does not outline any changes to rates or programs that would result in higher taxes on individual Canadians or families. The Conservatives are proposingÂ $750 million in additional annual funding to the CRA, with the goal of targeting "those rich enough to pay for expensive lawyers and accountants." Green Party The Greens, like the NDP, are proposing a new one per cent annual wealth tax, but only on families worth more than $20 million. The party says it would also close loopholes around stock options and capital gains taxes. The Greens say they alsoÂ would increase funding to the CRA and direct the agency to focus on Canadians "who hide vast wealth." The party says it would also tax any funds hidden in offshore tax havens. People's Party of Canada The People's Party of Canada platform says only that it would "cut personal income taxes, corporate taxesÂ and the personal capital gains tax after the deficit has been eliminated" â€” something the party says it could accomplish by the end of its first mandate. Clarifications This story has been edited from a previous version to remove a reference to the net worth of the wealthiest 1 per cent of Canadians in a section that was instead focused on income. Oct 04, 2021 1:11 PM ET Corrections This story has been updated from a previous version that stated that a family worth $100 million would be taxed $1 million under the NDP wealth tax. In fact, that family would pay $900,000 in annual taxes.
