BY STEFANI WALSH, CBC KIDS STAFF Oct 28, 2021 It feels like an extra-special treat when Halloween falls on a weekend. It means there's more time to prepare costumes, carve jack-o’-lanterns and fit in a bunch of activities before the grand finale that is trick-or-treating on Sunday evening. Maybe you’ll craft something creepy, or try some ghoulishly good recipes — and don't forget to take in a movie or two. To help keep the fun going, we’ve rounded up a list of spooky-but-not-scary episodes from your favourite CBC Kids shows to stream. Happy Halloween! NEW: Mighty Express — Nate’s Fright Night In this special new Halloween episode of Mighty Express, Freight Nate delivers candy for the town Halloween party, only to encounter Flicker dressed up as a ghost! You can also watch this episode on CBC TV the Saturday morning before Halloween (October 30). Make sure to check your local listings for air time. Stream it on CBC Gem. NEW: PJ Masks — Halloween Tricksters Part 1 and Part 2 The PJ Masks have to protect all the neighbourhood kids and their Halloween loot bags from Luna Girl, Night Ninja and the Wolfy Kids who have formed an alliance to steal them! This two-part Halloween special is only available for a limited time. Stream Part 1 on CBC Gem. Dino Ranch — The Spookasaurus In this episode (which is the second of two episodes, the first being Stop That Spinosaurus!), Jon gets spooked by a campfire story about a legendary dinosaur. Stream it on CBC Gem. The Adventures of Paddington — Paddington and Halloween It’s Halloween and Paddington goes treat-or-treating with Jonathan and Judy around Windsor Gardens, but Mr. Curry does not want to join in.

NEW: The Wonder Gang — The Bat Question Whyla is planning an extra spooky party when a question comes in about bats. Can the gang find out how bats fly in the dark before party time?

Stream it on CBC Gem.
