And sure, you can't always accomodate all the special requests and make individual meals for every child, but every once and a while, it can be fun to go big. Or small. Tiny food is enjoyed by the young and old alike, which is why these pirate booty-inspired pancake coins are a great way to have fun with food. This special recipe was inspired by The Story Store podcast episode Pancake Pirates — listen to the hilarious episode here while you prepare your delicious bounty! What you need: 1/2 cup all purpose flour 1 tbsp sugar 1/2 tsp baking powder 1/2 tsp baking soda 1/2 cup milk 1 1/2 tbsp whisked egg butter for the pan squeeze bottle/resealable bag (this will help you portion the tiny pancakes) syrup (to top your lil' cakes) patience (watching all these petite pancakes can test your patience, but everyone will smile so it can be worth it) How it's made: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, milk and egg or use pancake mix (for the pirate on the go). Give your little ones the task of mixing and stirring the ingredients, and tell them they are exploring the great seas for treasure. Once the batter is ready, use a tablespoon of butter in your pan — your burner should be set to medium heat (but you know your stove, so just use your best judgment). While the pan heats up, pour the batter into a squeeze bottle or use a resealable bag. If using a resealable bag, cut a tiny hole in the corner once ready to go. Once the pan is hot and coated with butter, have the little ones watch you squeeze tiny dollops of batter on the surface. If they want different tiny shapes — and not just coins — that's great! Their treasure bowl can be full of shapes directed by them! You'll want to keep them around the size of a quarter and be sure to keep an eye on them so they don't burn. When they separate from the pan with some ease, it's time to flip over — they can be flipped over all at once or one at a time, depending on the flipper situation in your kitchen. Since you're making a bunch, keep those beautiful teeny tiny pancakes warm (a foil covered bowl would work just fine). Once finished, fill a bowl with your small, scrumptuous treats and prepare your pirate-y finest. Patches and bandanas could be fun! Then you're ready to serve — add syrup or jam to taste, and set sails to the seven seas of yum. Share You might also like No related entries found. You might also like No related entries found.
