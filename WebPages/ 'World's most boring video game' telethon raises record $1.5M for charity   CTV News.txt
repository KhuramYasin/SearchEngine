Joe says. After he was first contacted by one of the organizers of "Desert Bus for Hope," Joe "jumped at the chance" and "booked everything last-minute." On his own dime, Joe hopped on a plane to Victoria and spent a week helping a group of strangers with an online broadcast that featured people playing whatâ€™s been dubbed â€œthe most boring video game ever created:" Desert Bus. â€œYou drive a bus from Tucson to Vegas in real-time in a bus that lists ever-so-slightly to the right,â€? Joe explains. â€œIt cannot be left unattended.â€? After eight hours of driving along a straight highway, you earn one point, then turn around to do it all over again. â€œItâ€™s miserable,â€? Joe says. But Joe didnâ€™t travel here to experience misery. Heâ€™s volunteering with the online telethon to encourage charity. Graham Stark, the co-founder of Desert Bus for Hope, says the more viewers donate, the longer players drive. â€œItâ€™s a wonderful mixture of generosity and spite,â€? Graham explains. â€œYou get to give to charity while you make us suffer.â€? When the players arenâ€™t taking turns enduring the driving, their viewers around the world are making suggestions about what they can do thatâ€™s more entertaining. â€œItâ€™s absolutely bizarre stuff that we could never have thought of,â€? Graham says the requests they end up doing, ranging from physical challenges, to comedic performances, to heartfelt conversations. â€œThen we ask, if you enjoyed that, throw a couple dollars in for the charity.â€? The charity is Childâ€™s Play, which donates video games to hospitals and domestic violence shelters across Canada and around the world. When Desert Bus for Hope first launched in 2007, organizers hoped to raise $5,000 for the charity. This year â€” after driving and broadcasting non-stop for more than six days straight â€” they raised a record total, more than C$1.5 million. That brings their 15-year total to more than US$8.3 million. â€œItâ€™s been incredible, rewarding, moving, and humbling,â€? Graham says. Which brings us back to Joe, who â€” after being a Desert Bus volunteer for the past six years â€” was inspired to quit his job in San Francisco this year and move to Victoria permanently. â€œI feel incredibly lucky that I get to be part of this family,â€? Joe says. â€œNot just once a year, but all the time.â€? A family of generous people who transform the boring into the bountiful.
