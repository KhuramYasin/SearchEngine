LIVE in USA October 19 · If you are a foreign educated national specializing in food engineering or agricultural science, your background and professional plans might be nationally important especially now—- during an ongoing healthcare crisis— that has been devastating the U.S. economy and the health of many US citizens. In order to qualify for an EB-2 National Interest Waiver Petition, you need to prove that your proposed endeavor is substantially meritorious and nationally important, you are well...-suited to advance it, and it is in the national interest of the U.S. to waive the labor certification process. The need for Food Engineers is urgent to evaluate supply chain processes, perform integrated planning, coordination and control of business processes and activities in the supply chain to deliver superior consumer value at less cost to supply chains, while also satisfying the requirements of stakeholders. The need for qualified food and agricultural engineers has been so urgent that the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have implemented several initiatives to support U.S. food and agriculture sector so that Americans continue to have access to a safe and robust food supply. If you are interested in in the EB-2 National Interest Waiver, contact our office today to schedule a consultation. Initial consultations can be scheduled on this FB page.
