The new 358-rental unit Louvre at Century Park building features an art gallery on its parkade pillars. Forty-four local artists got the opportunity to paint support columns within the parking garage and compete for five cash prizes. The winner of the top prize will take home $10,000. Artists were asked to create images inspired by Paris or items held in the Louvre Museumâ€™s collection to match the residential buildingâ€™s name. Painters came in every Saturday for the past five weeks to bring their creations to life. â€œWeâ€™ve had a really great response,â€? Schluessel said. â€œWe really wanted to create the theme of the Louvre.â€?

Schluessel said. One of the artists, Peter Gegolick, told CTV News Edmonton that the project has been a rewarding experience, as he got to meet and learn from other artists as they created their work. â€œPainting in a parkade isnâ€™t the first place you would think of doing artwork, but I love art doing competitions and meeting other artists,â€? Gegolick said. â€œItâ€™s really crazy almost seeing almost all the finished pieces at this point. â€œI think it was a cool and fun concept to take things that are in the Louvre that are very much structured and have been around for centuries and really put this cool spin on it,â€? he added.

Beaudin added. The prize winners will be announced on Nov. 27. Online voting runs from Monday to Friday at 5 p.m. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Geraldine Soh (@geri.pics) Edmonton Top Stories MacEwan Griffins take U SPORTS womenâ€™s soccer national title for the first time Elks recount difficult season, look forward to fresh start in 2022 Calgary father among the dead in B.C. mudslides Kenney says his confidence is high as UCP AGM wraps up Stony Plain man $2 million richer after scratch lottery win How to register Alberta children for the COVID-19 vaccine One-day Christmas market supports local animal rescue 'Like a tsunami': Survivor of B.C. flooding describes what happened, and what he found when he came back home Search CTV News Advertise on CTVNews.ca Political Ads Registry About CTV Careers CTV News Stox Press Room Editorial Standards & Policies Contact Us CTV News Programs CTV National News Power Play W5 CTV Question Period Pop Life Local News AtlanticBarrieCalgary EdmontonGuelphKitchener LethbridgeLondonMontreal Northern OntarioOttawa Prince AlbertRed DeerRegina SaskatoonToronto VancouverVancouver Island WindsorWinnipegYorkton CTV News App Video Help Stay up to date on the latest, breaking news Subscribe to newsletter Â© 2021 All rights reserved.
