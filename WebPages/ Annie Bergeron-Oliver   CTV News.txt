She specializes in political stories, and those relating to foreign affairs, health, the military, and the RCMP. Bergeron-Oliver previously worked as a reporter for CTV Ottawa, covering news and city politics. She has also covered federal politics for iPolitics.ca, worked at City News, and blogged for the Huffington Post from the Middle East. Bergeron-Oliver began her journalism career by completing internships at CBCâ€™s THE NATIONAL in New York City, MTV Canada, and Sports Illustrated. Born and raised in Ottawa, her passion for sport and exercise led Bergeron-Oliver to become a successful figure skater, in which she competed at the national level. She previously helped coach two Special Olympics world champions, and still coaches figure skating in her spare time. Bergeron-Oliver holds a Master of Science degree in Journalism from the Columbia Journalism School and an undergraduate degree in Physical Education and Health and Political Science from the University of Toronto. Away from Parliament Hill, Bergeron-Oliver can be found skating on local ice rinks in Ottawa, running along the canal, reading up on the latest news in federal politics, or making bad puns. She speaks English and French.
