The program was created to help address local labour shortages. To be eligible, newcomers need at least one year of work experience in one of Newfoundland’s in-demand occupations. It is also open to post-graduates who completed a Masters or Doctorate degree at Memorial University within the past three years. How the Priority Skills program works The Priority Skills Newfoundland and Labrador operates as an Expression of Interest (EOI) system. Interested candidates complete an EOI, and receive an invitation to apply through the provinceâ€™s online portal. Invited individuals receive a provincial nomination if they meet all the criteria for either the Skilled worker, or Express Entry Skilled Worker categories. This nomination will support a subsequent application for Canadian permanent residence to the federal government. Applicants fill out a questionnaire to get their EOI score. Those who get above 60 points will be visible to local employers who have accounts with the provinceâ€™s Office of Immigration and Multiculturalism. It is not necessary to have a job offer to apply to the provinceâ€™s newÂ Provincial Nominee Program. Applicants need to score highly in the EOI system and have received interest from local employers. Candidates need a Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) of at least five in order to be eligible. The results of the language test must be less than 12 months old. They also mustÂ be at least 21 years old and intend to live permanently in Newfoundland and Labrador.
