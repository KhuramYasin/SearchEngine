(Scott Miller / CTV News) Walkerton, Ont. - Competitors from across North America converged on the Brant Tract trails, north of Walkerton Saturday, for sled dog racing without snow. Itâ€™s called dryland mushing, and itâ€™s becoming as popular as the snow-based races. â€œThe winter season is getting shorter and shorter, so a lot of us are turning to ATVs, scooters, bikes, rigs, even running, to train our dogs, to get them ready for the really short winter season,â€? said Lisa Degennaro, the organizer of Saturdayâ€™s time trials. This isnâ€™t just a few people with dogs from Southwestern Ontario taking part, there are competitors and dogs from as far away as New York and Quebec. Bekka Haase came all the way from Buffalo for the races. â€œI do travel a lot. I go to Michigan, Wisconsin. Iâ€™m going to Ohio next weekend. Iâ€™m here a lot because youâ€™ve got such nice areas to train up here,â€? said Haase. While most snow based sled dog races require, as many as eight or 12 dogs, you only need one or two dogs for dryland mushing. â€œDryland is for people with smaller teams, with one or two dogs, like house dogs. You donâ€™t need to have a whole team. So I find the dryland is more accessible than the traditional sled dog racing,â€? said a competitor who came from Quebec. Saturdayâ€™s time trials are about keeping their dog athletes in shape, but itâ€™s also about being part of community of like-minded animal lovers. â€œOnce youâ€™re out there with them and youâ€™re one with your dog, connected only by the gangline, itâ€™s like this feeling of being a team, together. Thereâ€™s nothing else like it,â€? said Haase. â€œItâ€™s very, very unique. And, itâ€™s something really fun, too. What better way to spend time with your dogs than doing something they really love to do,â€? added DeGennaro.
