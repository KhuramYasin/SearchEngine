The cherries, the dry cake mix and then the melted butter all go in care-free, and what comes out has cakey bits, crunchy bits, oozy bits and gooey bits.

Put the cherries into the base of the dish with the sugar, cinnamon, cornflour and salt. Mix well. Now mix the cake ingredients. Put the sugar, flour, cocoa, cinnamon, baking powder and salt in a bowl and combine. Sprinkle the dry ingredients all over the fruit mix. Now drizzle over the melted butter and bake for 40â€“45 minutes. I like to serve this piping hot, with dollops of chocolate ice cream and a drizzle of melted chocolate. Recipe Tips You can use frozen cherries for this recipe, just ensure they're defrosted ahead of time.
