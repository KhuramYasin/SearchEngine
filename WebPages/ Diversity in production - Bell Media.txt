Bell Media recognizes the importance of inclusivity and the participation of women in key creative roles to ensure the development and production of Canadian content that reflects the interests of all Canadians. In September 2019, Bell Media published the following Women in Production Gender Parity Action Plan, a roadmap to achieving gender parity in key creative roles for our Canadian independent productions by 2025. The Women in Production Action Plan pdf Content Diversity Task Force The Bell Media Content Diversity Task Force in association with BIPOC TV and Film, recognizes that content decision-makers responsible for the stories told on our platforms, and the talent who tell them, need to be representative of our audiences. Comprised of content leaders from Bell Mediaâ€™s news, sports, radio, digital, programming, production, marketing, and communications teams, the Task Force is committed to reviewing Bell Mediaâ€™s processes and procedures in bringing content to the screen to ensure diverse voices play an integral role part in the story-telling process. HireBIPOC Bell Media is a proud foundational partner of HireBIPOC, an industry-wide database of BIPOC creatives and crew who work in Canadian screen-based industries. The online roster is a collaboration between more than 20 Canadian media organizations and BIPOC TV & Film to create meaningful change around industry hiring practices to ensure a more inclusive workforce. Bell Media has committed to making the use of HireBIPOC a specific condition of greenlight for original productions, ensuring that the site is used by internal groups and external companies. Diversity and Inclusion Content Advisory Committee The Diversity and Inclusion Content Advisory Committee is an internal sounding board for Bell Media’s content and programming teams regarding diversity and inclusion on-air, in our reporting, and our external promotion and marketing. The goal of the committee is to ensure consistency and inclusivity across all content and platforms. The committee’s membership includes diverse stakeholders with a set of lived experiences, backgrounds and expertise in media. The group provides guidance on equitable and inclusionary best practices and advises on language that has deemed to be outdated and exclusionary. What are you looking for?
