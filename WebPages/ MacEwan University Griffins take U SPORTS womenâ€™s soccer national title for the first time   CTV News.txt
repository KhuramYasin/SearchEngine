The matchup against the Trinity Western Spartans was won in penalty kicks after a 2-2 tie in regular time. The Spartans struck first 15 minutes into the game when Kathryn Harvey scored on the Griffins goalkeeper Breanna Truscott. The Griffins fought back and managed to fire two shots on the Spartans net but both were saved. A yellow card 35 minutes into the game against a Trinity Western player gave MacEwan a prime opportunity to even the score. @MacEwanGriffins women’s soccer win MacEwan’s first-ever @USPORTS GOLD!

Despite three more shots on net by MacEwan and one effort by Trinity Western, no further plays got past either goalkeeper. The match proceeded into a heated double-overtime resulting in several shots on net and a second yellow card for Western’s Elizabeth Hicks, forcing an ejection from the game. Despite missing their first shot during penalty kicks, the Griffins managed to score on all of their other attempts to take the gold medal.
