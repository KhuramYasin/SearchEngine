Patients who have had at least one recurrence of CDI after a primary episode and have completed at least one round of standard-of-care oral antibiotic therapy or have had at least two episodes of severe CDI resulting in hospitalization may be eligible for the study. Subjects may receive a second RBX2660 enema if they are deemed treatment failures following the initial enema per the protocol-specified treatment failure definition. Condition or disease Intervention/treatment Phase Clostridium Difficile Infection Infection Communicable Diseases Drug: RBX2660 Phase 3 Detailed Description: This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label Phase 3 study of a microbiota suspension of intestinal microbes. The primary assessments for this study are (i) safety via assessment of treatment-emergent adverse events and (ii) efficacy of RBX2660 preventing recurrent episodes of CDI measured at 8 weeks after treatment. Follow-up office visits occur at 1 week and 8 weeks after completing the initial study treatment. Telephone assessments occur at 4 weeks, and 4 and 6 months after the study. Patients who have had at least one recurrence of CDI after a primary episode and have completed at least one round of standard-of-care oral antibiotic therapy or have had at least two episodes of severe CDI resulting in hospitalization may be eligible for the study. Subjects may receive a second RBX2660 enema if they are deemed treatment failures following the initial enema per the protocol-specified treatment failure definition.
