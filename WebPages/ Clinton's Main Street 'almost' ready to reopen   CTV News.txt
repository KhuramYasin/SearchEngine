The County of Huron said they were going to replace the road and we didnâ€™t want to rip up new asphalt to fix the infrastructure underneath. Itâ€™s 100 years old and should have been replaced 30 years ago. We couldnâ€™t go another 30 years,â€? he explained. New sewers, sidewalks and streetlights are the main features of Clintonâ€™s Albert Street reconstruction that closed a main thoroughfare used by thousands of motorists each day. Of course, no one is more excited about the impending re-opening than Clintonâ€™s downtown businesses, which line the Main Street through town. â€œWeâ€™re very excited. We canâ€™t wait,â€? said Rack and Room Manager, Brenda Sjaarda. â€œThereâ€™s anticipation in the air since people have been so frustrated with the parking and everything else, so this will be really nice,â€? she said. COVID restrictions, coupled with the closure, made for a double whammy for Clintonâ€™s downtown business community. â€œIn our type of business, we rely 100 per cent on community donations, so if people canâ€™t get to us we donâ€™t have anything to sell,â€? said Sjaarda. â€œThere werenâ€™t many days where the businesses werenâ€™t accessible, but itâ€™s still an inconvenience. People canâ€™t park close and all that. Itâ€™s been hard on them, especially following the pandemic, which was the worst possible timing, but we just had to do it now,â€? said Ginn. The $3.7 million dollar reconstruction is expected to be completed this week, with Albert Street expected to re-open as soon as Friday.
