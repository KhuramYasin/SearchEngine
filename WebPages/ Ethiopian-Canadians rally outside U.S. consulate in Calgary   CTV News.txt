The group, participating in a global day of protest, voiced that they do not want the U.S. to interfere in Ethiopia. Many protesters held signs that said, â€œHands Off,â€? and, â€œNo More.â€? The country has been plagued by civil war between government troops and the Tigray opposition group called the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Front. The conflict has led to the worldâ€™s worst famine crisis in a decade and accusations that the government is promoting ethnic cleansing in the Tigray region. The Ethiopian prime minister won this yearâ€™s election in a landslide victory. â€œUsually in Africa, the governments, the leaders are the problems â€“ thatâ€™s what Canadians think,â€? said Solomon Mitiku, protest organizer. â€œBut what we have now in Ethiopia is a democratically elected government and an authoritarian group that was oppressing the country for more than three decades, now replaced by a democratically elected government.â€?
