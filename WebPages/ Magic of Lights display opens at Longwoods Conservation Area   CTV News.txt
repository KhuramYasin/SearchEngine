Organizers say the experience features "themed light displays using the latest LED technology and digital animations, including the all-new drive-through Blizzard Tunnel as well as fan favorites including 12 Days of Christmas, Winter Wonderland and Toyland." The full display, in the London region for the first time, is enjoyed entirely from inside your own vehicle. It includes over a million lights and takes an estimated 20 to 25 minutes to travel through. The event will also support a local charity, explained Kyla Woodcock, founder of Woodlo Productions Inc. â€œOur guests should come to the Magic of Lights because it will get into the holiday spirit and it will give back to our community and the United Way of Elgin-Middlesex.â€? Woodcock says she and her husband were inspired to bring the experience to London by their children. â€œMy husband and I took our kids to the Magic of Lights in Ottawa last year. And to see the show through the magic in their eyes. It inspired us to bring the magic of the lights to London this year.â€? Tickets start at $23 per vehicle and depend on the date. They went on sale Oct. 27 with a limited number of tickets available for each evening. The Magic of Lights display runs between 5:30 and 10 p.m. from Nov. 19, 2021 to Jan. 2, 2022. There's also another drive-thru experience in the region -- Winter Lights in St. Marys. There, also beginning Friday, cars and those on foot can move through vast displays setup through Milt Dunnell Field. In St. Marys, admission is by donation and the display is open 5-11 p.m. until Jan. 2, 2022. - With files from CTV News London's Sean Irvine London Top Stories BREAKING BREAKING | Police: 'Some fatalities' when SUV hits Wisconsin Christmas parade Aylmer, Ont. long-term care home in COVID-19 'suspect outbreak' Clinton's Main Street 'almost' ready to reopen Pedestrian killed in Ingersoll, Ont.
