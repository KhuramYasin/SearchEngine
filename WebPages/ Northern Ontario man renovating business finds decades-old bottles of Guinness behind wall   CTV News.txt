"We found numerous bottles. And among them were three full bottles of Guinness beer," said Wallace. â€œWe donâ€™t know the exact age of the bottles yet but we believe theyâ€™re from the late 1940s to early 1950s.â€? Wallace also found bottles of rum, bourbon and Canadian whisky behind the walls. He said some people have inquired about purchasing the empty bottles, but he isnâ€™t sure of their value just yet. Wallace said heâ€™s working on tracking down more information as to who might have put the bottles there. "We are slowly pushing out this story that someone can help solve this mystery," he said. "We believe the building was built in the 1930s, and received information that it used to be a grocery store, a general store and beside that they sold ice cream as wellâ€¦It later became a flower store and most recently a hair salon." Wallace said he is paying things forward and put in his own time capsule behind the drywall. Items include three bottles of Oâ€™Hara Irish Stout brewed in Carlow, Ireland, and a copy of a local newspaper. "My wife actually had the great idea and she said weâ€™ve got these full bottles that came out of the wall, why donâ€™t we put full bottles back in," said Wallace Top Stories Timmins Community Park Association adds sleighs to Hollinger Skate path Thousands line the streets to welcome Santa Claus to North Bay Bruce Mines alpaca farm under new management Potential public exposures to COVID-19 reported on Temiskaming Transit routes PHU declares COVID-19 outbreak at Pope Francis Elementary School in Timmins Rooster among record number of animals at Sault Ste.
