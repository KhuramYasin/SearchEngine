(AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File) Tesla Inc chief Elon Musk said on Friday that the company's mobile application was coming back online after an app server outage earlier prevented many owners from connecting to their cars. Musk was responding to a Tesla owner's tweet, who said that he was experiencing a "500 server error" to connect his Model 3 through the iOS app in Seoul, South Korea. "Should be coming back online now. Looks like we may have accidentally increased verbosity of network traffic," Musk said. The outage was first reported by Electrek. About 500 users reported they faced an error at around 4:40 p.m. ET (2140 GMT), according to outage monitoring website Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from a series of sources, including user-submitted errors on its platform. There were just over 60 reports at around 9:20 p.m. ET. "Apologies, we will take measures to ensure this doesn't happen again," Musk said. Should be coming back online now. Looks like we may have accidentally increased verbosity of network traffic. Apologies, we will take measures to ensure this doesn’t happen again. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 20, 2021 Reporting by Nivedita Balu and Bhargav Acharya in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Sandra Maler MORE AUTOS NEWS Tesla app coming back online after server outage, Musk says Tensions boil in Qatar between Mercedes and Red Bull GM aims to tackle chip shortage with new designs made in North America Glitchy features dent electric SUV reliability, survey finds Hamilton: F1 'duty bound' to raise awareness of human rights Stellantis recalls heavy duty diesel Rams to fix fuel pumps Mercedes wants to review Hamilton-Verstappen overtake move Zhou becomes Formula One's first Chinese driver with Alfa Romeo Search CTV News Advertise on CTVNews.ca Political Ads Registry About CTV Careers CTV News Stox Press Room Editorial Standards & Policies Contact Us CTV News Programs CTV National News Power Play W5 CTV Question Period Pop Life Local News AtlanticBarrieCalgary EdmontonGuelphKitchener LethbridgeLondonMontreal Northern OntarioOttawa Prince AlbertRed DeerRegina SaskatoonToronto VancouverVancouver Island WindsorWinnipegYorkton CTV News App Video Help Stay up to date on the latest, breaking news Subscribe to newsletter © 2021 All rights reserved.
