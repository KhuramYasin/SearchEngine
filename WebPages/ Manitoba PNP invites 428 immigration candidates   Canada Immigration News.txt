Shelby Thevenot Published on November 19th, 2021 at 11:00am EST Aa Accessibility Font Style Serif Sans Font Size A A Manitoba held a new immigration draw on November 18. TheÂ Manitoba Provincial Nominee ProgramÂ (MPNP) invited a total of 426 immigration candidates across threeÂ Provincial Nominee ProgramsÂ (PNPs): Skilled Workers in Manitoba â€” 376 invitations with a minimum EOI score of 464; Skilled Workers Overseas â€” 22 invitations with a minimum EOI score of 726; and International Education Stream â€” 30 invitations with no EOI score requirement. Among these invitations, 68 went to candidates in the Express EntryÂ system. Discover if Youâ€™re Eligible for Canadian Immigration About Express Entry Express EntryÂ is Canadaâ€™s application management system forÂ three federal high-skilled immigration programs: theÂ Canadian Experience Class, theÂ Federal Skilled Worker Program, and theÂ Federal Skilled Trades Program. Immigration candidates who submit a profile to the Express Entry system are ranked based on theÂ Comprehensive Ranking SystemÂ (CRS). Points are awarded for factors like age, work experience, education, and language skills among others. The highest-scoring candidates receive invitations to apply for permanent residence throughÂ regularÂ Express Entry draws. It is possible to skip the PNP process andÂ receive a permanent residence invitationÂ by directly applying through Express Entry. However, a provincial nomination means an automatic 600 CRS points, which effectively guarantees candidates will receive anÂ Invitation to ApplyÂ (ITA) in a subsequentÂ Express Entry draw. Manitoba immigration programs ManitobaÂ manages itsÂ immigration programsÂ through the MPNP, which supports immigration applications to the federal government. Canadian provinces do not have the ability to give out permanent residency status, but they can help an application along by issuing provincial nominations. If you want to benefit from a nomination from Manitoba, you need to register an Expression of Interest with the MPNP. This puts you in a position to receive an LAA through theÂ Skilled Workers in ManitobaÂ andÂ Skilled Workers OverseasÂ streams. Manitoba then ranks candidates out of 1,000 points for their human capital factors, as well as their connections to the province. The Skilled Workers Overseas Category and Skilled Workers in Manitoba categories are designed to allow the province to identify candidates who meet its labour market needs. Candidates overseas need to demonstrate connections to Manitoba through the likes of close family ties, previous experience in the province, or an invitation through one of Manitobaâ€™s Strategic Recruitment Initiatives. You do not need to be living in Manitoba at the time of your application to be eligible. In order to receive an invitation under the Skilled Workers in Manitoba category, you need to have a full-time job offer from a provincial employer. International graduates who complete their education in Manitoba can receive an invitation under theÂ International Education StreamÂ if they can demonstrate that they have in-demand skills.
