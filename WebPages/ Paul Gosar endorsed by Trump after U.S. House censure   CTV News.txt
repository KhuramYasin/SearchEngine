Scott Applewhite) Share: Reddit Share Text: NEW YORK -- Former U.S. president Donald Trump is endorsing Rep. Paul Gosar, one day after the Arizona Republican was censured by the House of Representatives for posting a violent cartoon video that depicted a character with his face killing one with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's. Trump, in a statement, hailed Gosar as â€œa loyal supporter of our America First agendaâ€? and â€œhighly respected in Arizona,â€? and said he â€œhas my Complete and Total Endorsement!â€? The statement made no mention of the House's rare rebuke - just the fourth in nearly 40 years - which also stripped Gosar of his two committee assignments, on the Natural Resources and the Oversight and Reform panels. Gosar has said the video, which was produced by his taxpayer-funded office, had been mischaracterized and was not intended to be a threat. In addition to Ocasio-Cortez, the the video also depicted Gosar's character attacking President Joe Biden with swords. Gosar is no stranger to controversy. He's made appearances at fringe right-wing events, including a gathering in Florida last February hosted by a man who has promoted white supremacist beliefs, and earlier this year looked to form an America First Caucus with other hard-line Republican House members that aimed to promote â€œAnglo-Saxon political traditions.â€? Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, meanwhile, has called the censure an â€œabuse of powerâ€? by Democrats and signaled payback should Republicans retake the House majority next year.
