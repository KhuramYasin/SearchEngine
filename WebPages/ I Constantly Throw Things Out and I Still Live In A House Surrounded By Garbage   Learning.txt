We are running out of space. My family can still maintain our day-to-day, but I look around and, my word, how did we let it get this bad? There is garbage everywhere. It’s a disaster. Not everyone prioritizes climate change. Because sometimes people weren't taught to worry. Ownership Has A Success Metric When I think about it more, every item signals someone’s success, whether it’s mine, or a triumph of engineering or supply chain management. For every item that has been added to the pile, there’s some story to tell. But everything adds up, and it gets to a point where we’ve amassed waste. A lot of which will end up in a landfill somewhere. I sometimes think: “There you go, kid. Enjoy your McDonald’s toy. Let it always remind you of what we did to the planet and what we didn’t do to stop it.” At the end of the day, it’s garbage. Some of which will probably outlive me and my child. The Great Garbage Disaster When I think about my daughter’s future and the planet she will live on, I try to stay away from debates about climate change. Climate change has become, in some ways, an “us vs. them” situation, despite the fact that it is something that I believe affects us all. I see this as a byproduct of the confusion of climate science for those of us who aren’t scientists. One can only glean so much from a one-sided Facebook post, so I understand how confusing it can become to discuss large concepts in a vacuum. Which is why I like to frame it as a “great garbage disaster” — because I believe focusing on one element that’s easier to comprehend is a good entrypoint to what’s happening. If most adults are finding the science of climate change divisive, confusing and alienating, then my daughter is probably going to need to be eased into it. Free of debate and politics. Because garbage is everywhere. But reducing it has a real-life impact that a person can see and measure. The Plastic Problem If you think of a mound of garbage in terms of the events that led to their arrival, it’s easier to comprehend how we got into this predicament at all. A garbage heap will include food wrap, personal protective equipment (like masks) and a variety of plastic stuff that aids in society’s ability to function. The garbage at one point in time was purposeful, and now it’s not. Which is why it is important to change norms. While plastic wrap may have helped preserve someone’s leftovers (because it is very efficient at doing so), could a glass jar have worked just as well? Or maybe a reusable wrap made of beeswax? These are individual choices that can lead to less waste, but I do understand it’s not just a me or you problem. Many industries still have a lot of catching up to do, but occasionally we do hear of small and large changes from some corporations in their commitment to “going green.” There are even proposed plans for a carbon-free future. So when I saw the kids rally together on September 20 for a climate strike, I applauded them. Because as an adult, surrounded by trash despite constantly throwing things out, I am guilty. I deserve their ire. They are the change that is going to hopefully steer us back on track. And I don't want to be the old curmudgeon collecting his garbage while the kids try to correct course. House on Fire Two years prior to this strike, Greta Thunberg spoke to a crowd in New York. At one point she declared, “Our house is on fire.” Seeing and hearing Greta made me think of my own daughter. To my daughter's generation: if your house is on fire, I promise to not go looking for marshmallows. In fact, I’m quite glad the world’s youth have a banner to unite under. I hope their idealism isn’t stunted by corporations who seem to find ways out of being accountable. I hope their idealism doesn’t fade. So I want to do my part to support them, and to support the planet. I plead with people to not buy my daughter plastic toys, like a L.O.L doll which has more packaging than a single item requires. I beg my own family not to buy these things, but there always seems to be more. We do pay attention to what we throw out, and how we throw it out. I sort our garbage. And while recycling in its current state may be inefficient in some ways, I do believe it can get better. But my family is still figuring out its garbage situation. For some, a struggling planet is enough to halt any plans for having children. But that isn't the case for everyone. Framing For Kids When I frame the conversation as a garbage problem, my family feels more in control of it. Like we can do something that is supporting the future generations. And I want to do something. Too often, we can educate our kids about the problems and then continue in our old ways. There can be an expectation that things have "worked out" so far, so why change? We produce, we consume, and maybe sometimes we recycle. But the garbage heap just gets bigger and bigger. Because habits are extremely challenging to break, especially when they have been norms for as long as they have been. But that doesn’t mean they are impossible to change. The change may just be challenging. A challenge isn’t a bad thing — I think it’s probably exactly what many people need. Sometimes people need to be at the edge before they recognize the will to change. I’m just not prepared to let it get worse for my family. I want to do what we can as a family to be part of the solution. Garbage may feel like a cultural certainty, but if we all take some steps to buckle down on the global garbage disaster, I think we might be happily surprised by our own impact. That goes triple for corporations.
