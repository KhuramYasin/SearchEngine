In August, a report by Nicholas Keung of the Toronto Star showed that the backlog as of July 6, 2021 stood at about: 375,000 permanent residence applicationsÂ 703,000 temporary residence applicationsÂ 370,000 Canadian citizenship applications. The Star reported that this figure did not include Canadian citizenship applications sitting in IRCC’s mailrooms that have yet to be processed. 1,448,000 total applications in inventory In an email to CIC News, an IRCC spokesperson explained “Ongoing international travel restrictions, border restrictions, limited operational capacity overseas and the inability on the part of clients to obtain documentation due to the effects of COVID-19 have created barriers within the processing continuum. This hinders IRCCâ€™s ability to finalize applications, creating delays that are outside IRCCâ€™s control.” At the same time, the spokesperson acknowledged the challenges that applicants are facing, noting “Despite our efforts, we know that some applicants have experienced considerable wait times with the processing of their applications, and we continue to work as hard as possible to reduce processing times. We thank them for their patience and understanding at this moment, and we look forward to welcoming them to Canada.” IRCC also shared data on the number of applications it has processed during the pandemic: 337,000 permanent residence applications processed between January and September 2021. It processed some 214,000 applications in 2020. 1,500,000 temporary residence applications processed between January and September 2021. This compares to nearly 1,700,000 applications in 2020. 134,000 Canadian citizenship applications processed between January and September 2021.
