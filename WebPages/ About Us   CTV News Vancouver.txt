Broadcasting out of the old Vancouver public library building at Robson and Burrard, we signed onto the air early in the morning on Sept. 22, 1997 as Vancouver Television. We later changed our name to VTV, then BC-CTV, then CTV British Columbia and now CTV News Vancouver. We currently broadcast 38 hours of local news every week, along with the flagship CTV National News every night. CTV News Vancouver has been named the home of â€œCanadaâ€™s Best Local Newscastâ€? multiple times by the countryâ€™s major journalism and broadcasting organizations, including the Radio Television and Digital News Association and the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television. We've covered every major news story across the province for almost a quarter century, but perhaps the most memorable highlight was our role as the official broadcast partner of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. You can find our latest news here at CTVNewsVancouver.ca, on the CTV News app, or on our Twitter, Facebook and Instagram pages.
