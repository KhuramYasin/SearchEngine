A popular trip for both locals and visitors. About Hiking up Mount Ulriken is one of the most popular tours in Bergen. There are several different routes to the top of Ulriken, here is a couple of the most popular: The most popular route: Start at Montana and walk the Sherpa steps (1333 stept): Take bus No. 12 from the city center to Montana. Follow the signs to Montana Hostel. Turn right just before the hostel. Follow the gravel road uphill for approximately 15 mintues (0,8 kilometers). At the end of a gravel road you can select multiple paths up to Ulriken. Here you'll see a bench and signboard with a map and a river on your right. Follow the path straight onwards and it will make a sharp left bend. A few minutes later you'll see the steps. From here you follow the steps all the way to the top. "Eggen": If you do not like to climb stairs, you can take the path starting behind the signpost and the bench called Eggen. The distance to the top is pretty much the same, and the view is very nice. However, on this path you will get a very steep climbing section. If you suffer from vertigo we recommend you walk the Sherpa steps. This route is not recommended for children. The trail is not well marked. Start from Ulriken Cable car: Take the bus to Haukeland hospital from outside Exhibition shopping center in the city center. Walk across the footbridge and follow the signs to Ulriksbanen. Just behind the cable car is the start point for the track up to the top. It starts with some stairs and continues in the forrest for a short while. The track is marked with signs "Ulriken up". Turn left when you reach the first plateau before the red house. If you keep to the right and go over a small bridge, you come to the former parking lot at Montana. (Then follow the route above). Make sure you do not walk in the bike path, it is well marked and you need to cross it a couple of times on your way up. Starting at the cable car will add about 30-45 minutes to your hike depending on how fast you walk. Duration: The walk to Ulriken is suitable for all ages and takes about 1.5 hours from Montana. However, you will probably see a lot of very fit Norwegians running past using the steps as exercise rather than leisure. Calculate a bit more time if you are walking with children. The walk offers great views all the way. This is a very popular trip for both locals and visitors. It is steep, but you are rewarded with stunning views along the way and of course panoramic views of Bergen and the surroundings from the top. From the top of Ulriken you can take Ulriken Cable Car back if you do not want to walk down. Or you can continue accross Vidden to Mount Fløyen (approximately 5 hours). On top of Ulriken you can also treat yourself to a great meal at Skyskraperen Restaurant.
