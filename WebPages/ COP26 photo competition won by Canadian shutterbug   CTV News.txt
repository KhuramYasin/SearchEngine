COP26 photo competition won by Canadian shutterbug | CTV News Home FOLLOW ON Advertisement CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT Canadian photojournalist wins COP26 photography competition Christy Somos CTVNews.ca Writer @C_Somos Contact Published Sunday, November 14, 2021 1:35PM EST Share: Reddit Share Text: TORONTO -- A Canadian photographer won top prize at the UN climate conference photo competition. Jo-Anne McArthurâ€™s images of animals won two prizes at COP26, which officially wrapped up in Glasgow, Scotland on Nov. 12. McArthur said on CTV News Channel that the most crucial photo she snapped was of cows in transport at the Bulgarian-Turkish border. â€œFor me thatâ€™s the most important image here in fact, the hidden aspect of eating animals, using animals and animals in transport,â€? she said. â€œHere in Canada we transport millions of animals every year, you know itâ€™s one of the things we donâ€™t think about when weâ€™re eating animals.â€? McArthur, who is vegan, said that â€œwhen it comes to our use of animals, we often donâ€™t think of the other ramifications â€“ of course itâ€™s not good for the animals, but its not good for its contributions to climate change as well.â€?

I think itâ€™s interesting to always bring it back to that language.â€? Discussing her work, which requires McArthur to travel extensively and sometimes in dangerous situations, she acknowledged that her travel contributes to climate change but that â€œin the greater good,â€? her work makes the plight of these animals, which are affected by human-made climate change, visible. â€œWe donâ€™t see the animals that are affected by climate change, theyâ€™re in factory farms by the billionsâ€¦so that is what I do in particular, focusing on animals and their sentience, how theyâ€™re affected by us and how us using them affects the rest of the world,â€? she said.
