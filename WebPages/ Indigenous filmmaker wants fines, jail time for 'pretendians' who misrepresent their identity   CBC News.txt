The move comes shortly after award-winning filmmaker Michelle Latimer's identity claims were questioned by members of the Kitigan Zibi community. Social Sharing Tamara Bell points to U.S. legislation with $250K fine or 5-year prison term for false representation Angela Sterritt Â· CBC News Â· Posted: Jan 19, 2021 4:00 AM PT | Last Updated: February 8 Tamara Bell, shown at a news conference on Monday, says the federal government must enact new rules to authenticate Indigenous identity.Â (Mike Zimmer/CBC ) A Haida filmmaker is pushing for new legislation in Canada to penalize people who wrongly claim to be indigenous and access grants, awards and jobs intended for Indigenous people. Tamara Bell said she wants those who misrepresent their identity to face fines and even prison time. In her press conference, Bell didn't distinguish between those who may intentionally misrepresent their identity and those who do it in error.Â Bell's move comes on the heels of Kitigan Zibi community members questioning filmmaker Michelle Latimer's claims to be of "Algonquin, MÃ©tis and French heritage, from Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg (Maniwaki), Quebec." Latimer, who recently directed the CBC television series Trickster and the documentary Inconvenient Indian, said she is an artist of mixed Indigenous and settler ancestry. She said she genuinely believed she had a legitimate connection to Kitigan Zibi when she made her claims, but said she made a mistake in naming that community before doing the work to verify the linkage. She said her claim rested on the "oral history" of her maternal grandfather and that she had recently traced one line of Indigenous ancestry dating back to the 1700s. Award-winning filmmaker Michelle Latimer's Indigenous identity under scrutiny "I think as Indigenous people, we have to draw a line in the sand," Bell said Monday at a news conference in Vancouver.Â It's not clear if this proposed legislation would apply to someone in Latimer's situation. Right now, most Canadian institutions â€”Â even those that administer funds allocated specifically for Indigenous people â€” use self-identification as the gold standard for identifying who is Indigenous. That means anyone can simply say "I am Indigenous" to authenticate their Indigeneity. Some, such asÂ LatimerÂ and author Joseph Boyden,Â have accessed grant money, awards or other opportunities because they identified as Indigenous. Over the years that he claimed to have an Indigenous identity, BoydenÂ received awards andÂ acceptedÂ speaking engagements intended for Indigenous people. In 2005, Boyden was awarded theÂ McNally Robinson Aboriginal Book of the Year Award, which cameÂ with a $5,000 award. He also received an honoraryÂ award from the Hnatyshyn Foundation when it launched itsÂ REVEAL Indigenous Art AwardsÂ to recognizeÂ Indigenous Canadian artists in 2017. Boyden gaveÂ a series of paid keynote speeches in whichÂ he identified himself asÂ an Indigenous person, including a keynote for the City of Winnipeg's summit on racial inclusion in 2015Â and one for the Kenjgewin Teg Educational Institute in 2016, whereÂ he spoke about having an Anishinaabe mother. Author Joseph Boyden defends Indigenous heritage after investigation Speaking in support of Bell's proposed legislation, MÃ©tis Elder Corie Thunderchild said, "People can't just come in and squeeze out dollars. We've gone a long time being starved and we have to stand up." 'Canada often turns a blind eye' Bell is proposing an Indigenous Identity Act, which sheÂ hopes will deterÂ what she and others call "pretendians"Â from assuming Indigenous identity. She pointed toÂ legislationÂ in the United States known as the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, a truth-in-advertising law thatÂ makes it illegal "to offer or display for sale, or sell any art or craft product in a manner that falsely suggests it is Indian produced." AÂ first-time violation of the actÂ could land a person a five-year prison term orÂ a $250,000 fine, or both.Â "Unfortunately, Canada often turns a blind eye to the wholesale theft and exploitation of Indigenous identity, which has become a widespread problem all too frequently," Bell said. Bell is calling on the Indigenous Screen Office, the Canada Media Fund,Â Telefilm Canada, CBC and the National Film BoardÂ to support the call for Indigenous authentication legislation.Â In a statement, the executive director of the Indigenous Screen Office, Jesse Wente,Â said the ISOÂ "will undertake a community engagement process in 2021 regarding Indigenous identity that will inform futureÂ policy directions." He said the process will start "over the nextÂ two months beginning with elders and Indigenous organizations withÂ knowledge and expertise in this area, and will extend into the summer with broader consultations."Â Filmmaker Michelle Latimer is photographed in Toronto on Aug. 19, 2020.

(Chris Young/The Canadian Press) The statement alsoÂ explainedÂ "this is a nuanced issue that requires time to listen to the many different community perspectives ... we accept our responsibility in taking a leadership role for the sector on this important issue through this process." Bell saidÂ she understands the sensitivity of the issue of Indigenous identity, with colonial apparatuses like residential school and the Sixties ScoopÂ removing children from their communities and families.Â But she said there are still ways to verify Indigenous identities â€” one can get a letter from an elder, their community, a relative or their band to verify which community they are from. "Right now it's a free for all," she said.

Bell is supported by several Indigenous elders, includingÂ Elizabeth Sinclair from the PeguisÂ First Nation,Â Gail Sparrow from the MusqueamÂ Nation, and Corie Thunderchild from the MÃ©tisÂ people.Â She saidÂ she is also in conversationÂ with two Canadian senators.Â The CBC asked for comment from Indigenous Services Canada about itsÂ consideration of such an act.Â ItÂ saidÂ it is working on a response.Â Clarifications This story has been updated to clarify that there are questions about Michelle Latimerâ€™s Indigenous identity claims; to better reflect Latimer's understanding of her identity; and to clarify some details of the suggested legislation.
