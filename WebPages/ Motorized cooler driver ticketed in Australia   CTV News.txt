Motorized cooler driver ticketed in Australia | CTV News Home FOLLOW ON Advertisement WORLD Police in Australia impound motorized cooler allegedly operated by unlicensed driver Alexandra Mae Jones CTVNews.ca writer @AlexandraMaeJ Contact Published Sunday, November 21, 2021 5:16PM EST Swan Hill Police Service pulled over a 25-year-old man last week who was driving a motorized cooler without a license. Share: Reddit Share Text: TORONTO -- Itâ€™s common knowledge that you need a driverâ€™s license to operate a vehicle in most countries, but police in Australia are adding a new type of transportation to the list of what constitutes a vehicle: motorized coolers. According to a Facebook post, Swan Hill Police Service pulled over a 25-year-old man last week who was driving a â€œmotorized esky on the footpath in Victoria Street Kerangâ€?. Esky refers to an Australian brand of portable coolers. A photo of the motorized cooler shows a bright blue cooler sitting on a metal platform with four wheels, an engine in the back, and a set of what looks like bike handlebars, with the cooler appearing to form the seat of the makeshift vehicle. The entire thing appears smaller than a lawn tractor. Police stated that the driver of the cooler did not have a driverâ€™s license and had never, in fact, held one. They added that the driver passed a breathalyzer test and was not intoxicated. â€œThis motorised esky is considered a vehicle due to the size/engine capacity and must comply with legistlative requirements and road rules,â€? the police statement read. The cooler has been impounded for 30 days, and the driver is facing charges of driving without a licence and driving â€œan unregistered motor vehicle.â€? Police added a link to a website that explained the laws surrounding hoverboards, Segways and other personal mobility devices in Australia. Motorized personal mobility devices were defined as being self-balancing and having either a single wheels or wheels in a â€œside-by-side configuration,â€? and are required to meeting registration and licensing requirements to be used on roads or footpaths. Although several examples were listed, motorized coolers did not make an appearance.
