Commemorating the lives of nearly 400 people, each panel was lovingly created by the family, friends or lovers of someone who had lost their life. Tom Foskett-Barnes explores the legacy of this rarely seen artefact in Quilts of Love on Radio 3's Between the Ears on Thursday 11 November.

He said: "It happened to be laid out on the Mall. I didn't even know about it, that's how ignorant I was!" Friedland revealed that the scale of the event took him aback. He explained: "At a certain point walking through the quilt I looked up and I could not see the end of the people - the live people, not the dead ones. "I realised this is not about the dead people, this is about the live people realising the impact the dead people had that can never be taken away. "And I got inspired to bring the quilt to the UK." Image source, Alamy Image caption, The NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt on display in 1996 in Washington DC The huge stigma that existed around AIDS in the 1980s, explored recently by the hit drama series It's A Sin, external, meant there was "no national, formal recognition or commemoration of the crisis, external". Rather it was a grassroots project, in the form of the UK AIDS Memorial Quilt, which came to play that role. Image source, Diane Dixon Image caption, The UK AIDS Memorial Quilt on display in 1994 The UK AIDS Memorial Quilt, external is made up of 48 panels, each of which contains a series of smaller panels within. When exhibited, personal testimonials, photos and documents are also used to reveal more about the emotional stories behind the panels. Among those memorialised in fabric are Indiana Jones actor Denham Elliot and the artist Derek Jarman. Time is what keeps the light from reaching us by Cassandre Greenberg is an ode to Derek Jarmanâ€™s film Blue, a poetic reckoning with his grief at the loss of friends, lovers and his own life as a result of Aids-related illnesses Image source, The Birch Archive, Bishopsgate Institute "An impact that is being felt by people living today" As well as learning about the origins of the project from Barton Friedland, Tom also spoke with some of the charities involved in putting the quilts back on display earlier this year, external - the first time the entire collection had been shown since 1994. Anna Brewster, Volunteer and Services Manager at The Food Chain, described how the new exhibition exposed the stigma that remained around HIV. She said: "One of our service users came to see the exhibition and one of the things he found the most difficult was the love that went into the panels that people's famillies created for people they had lost - their sons, their brothers, their family members. "When he disclosed his HIV status his family disowned him and still to this day won't speak to him. So it was really hard seeing how much love was expressed for these people but wasn't expressed for him. "This is not a piece of lost history, this is still an impact that is being felt by people who are living today."
