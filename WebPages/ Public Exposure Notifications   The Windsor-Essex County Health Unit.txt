The virus can also spread when someone touches an object or surface with the virus on it and then touches their mouth, nose or eyes, without washing or sanitizing their hands. Symptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild to severe. It is important that anyone who has symptoms stay home and take the online self-assessment tool. The WECHU will reach out directly to anyone identified as a high-risk close contact of a confirmed case to provide further instructions.
