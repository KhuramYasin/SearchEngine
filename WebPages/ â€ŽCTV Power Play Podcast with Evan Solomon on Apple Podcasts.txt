The early problems with truncated episodes and problems downloading seem to be gone. It went away for a few months and since coming back has been reliable. Hopi&Maggie , 2021-08-25 Sorry. I canâ€™t listen any longer I have been listening to Evan for many years on many platforms and while I do respect his knowledge and insight I can no longer listen to his â€œtoughâ€? questioning tactics, constant interruptions and ultimately his need to control the narrative. A good interviewer sets up the guest to present an intimate and informed perspective. Evan has become a bully and a bore. He would be more welcome with his own headliner show that could showcase his egotistical talent. A blemish on CBC. Programmer Bee , 2021-01-22 Keep asking tough questions! I often disagree with Power Playâ€™s take on events but so long as they keep throwing pointed questions at our politicians I donâ€™t care. Politicians need to be scrutinized to the bone regardless of the party and they should be able to answer whatever is thrown at them.
