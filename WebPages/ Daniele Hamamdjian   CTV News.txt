Other notable assignments during Hamamdjianâ€™s tenure as London Correspondent include the 2015 Nepal earthquake, the funeral of Nelson Mandela, the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games, and the crisis in Ukraine.

Hamamdjian has also delivered coverage of significant Canadian news stories, including the Attawapiskat housing crisis in 2011, which led to testimonies of alleged rampant sex abuse in Attawapiskat and native communities across the country. Hamamdjian and the CTV crew were also the first international reporting team on the ground in Haiti after the devastating earthquake that rocked the country in 2010.
