The closed captioning process isnâ€™t an automated process created by computers â€“ a popular misconception. Captions are created by people that are highly skilled and trained to catch nuances that computers arenâ€™t able to do at this time. The most difficult work to accurately caption is the content in live broadcasts, like news and sports, as the captions have to be created at the same time as the broadcast. This video explains how live captioners generate accurate and timely captions under pressure.
