The latest draw is Quebecâ€™s 12th of the year and the second smallest draw held so far by the province in 2021. In the second part of the year, most draws invited over 500 immigration candidates.Â A total of 3,256 candidates have now been invited to apply for permanent selection by the province through Arrima. What is the Quebec Regular Skilled Worker Program? The Quebec Regular Skilled Worker Program is for skilled workers who are more likely to establish themselves economically in the province. The program is popular among skilled workers and international graduates who wish to immigrate permanently to Quebec to work. Candidates who are invited to apply for permanent selection have a maximum of 60 days to submit their application and pay processing fees. Quebec aims to process complete applications within 6 months, starting on the date all the required information has been received. This includes all forms and documents. If successful, candidates will get a Certificat de sÃ©lection du QuÃ©bec (CSQ or Quebec Selection Certificate). They can then use this document to apply for permanent residence to the Canadian federal government. Those who wish to settle in Quebec, are assessed under a different system than applicants who want to settle somewhere else in Canada. Quebecâ€™s immigration programs are managed by the provinceÂ and are distinct from Canadaâ€™s federal programs. Quebec admission targets for 2022 Quebec recently released its immigration admission targets for 2022.Â Most newcomers are expected to come through the provinceâ€™s economic immigrationÂ programs, including theÂ Quebec Skilled Worker ProgramÂ (QSWP) and theÂ QuÃ©bec experience programÂ (PEQ). The plan calls for the admission of 49,500 to 52,500 immigrants in 2022 across all immigration categories, as well as an additional 18,000 admissions to reach the admission levels that were not met by the federal government in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that more than 70,000 newcomers could be admitted to the province of Quebec in 2022. If you received an invitation to apply for a Quebec Selection Certificate, you may emailÂ qcita@canadavisa.comÂ to learn about the next steps regarding your application.
