Anything hot and comforting, like a hearty stew, a delicious soup or even creamy hot chocolate will do the trick. This creamy carrot soup will warm you right up. It’s made from just a few simple ingredients that you probably already have in your cupboards, plus it contains nutritious red lentils. But not to worry, the soup is puréed, so if you have someone who doesn’t like lentils, they’ll never know they’re there! I know all too well how kids can sometimes be picky when certain dishes are placed in front of them, which is why I’ve made this recipe customizable. Some kids don’t like certain spices and herbs (mine aren’t fans of thyme) so you can choose to make the recipe as-is, without any additional flavours, or you can boost the flavours with your favourite herbs and spices. This recipe is thick and creamy, without the use of dairy products. It’s filled with rich carrot flavour, a hint of ginger and it stands perfectly fine on its own. But you can serve it however you like — with veggies on the side, raw or roasted, or even with your favourite sandwiches. You'll Need: 1 tbsp olive oil 1 medium yellow onion, diced 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated 3 c. carrots, peeled and chopped into 1” pieces (approximately 1 lb or 7 medium carrots) 1/2 cup red lentils, rinsed 5.5 cups low sodium vegetable broth salt and pepper to taste Instructions: Over medium high heat add olive oil to a large pot. Once heated, add the onions and cook until they brown — about 4-5 minutes. Add garlic and ginger for 1 more minute, stirring frequently to prevent burning. Add the carrots, red lentils and vegetable broth. Stir to combine. Bring mixture to a boil, stir, then lower temperature, cover and simmer. When a fork can easily pierce through the carrots (after roughly 25 minutes of active simmering), remove pot from heat. Using a hand-held immersion blender, purée the mixture for a few minutes until you have a thick, creamy soup. Always be very careful when blending hot soup! (If you don’t have an immersion blender, blend the soup in batches in a blender. Be sure to remove the center cap from the blender lid to allow the steam to escape and cover the hole with a kitchen towel while it’s blending.) Once blended, taste for seasonings and add salt and pepper to taste. Serve in bowls as-is or garnish with however you like. Additional Notes: To boost flavour, add either of the following during step 2: add 2-3 teaspoons of yellow curry powder OR 1 teaspoon of dried thyme. For garnish, I like to use fresh parsley and a splash of canned coconut milk (see pictures), but some other ideas include croutons, chopped green onions or chives, freshly cracked black pepper, red pepper flakes or even fresh thyme leaves.
