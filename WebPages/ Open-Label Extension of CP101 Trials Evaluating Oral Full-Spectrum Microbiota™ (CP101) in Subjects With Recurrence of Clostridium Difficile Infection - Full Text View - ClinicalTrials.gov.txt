Study Details Tabular View No Results Posted Disclaimer How to Read a Study Record Study Description Go to Top of Page Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Brief Summary: This is an open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of CP101 treatment in 1) Subjects in CDI-001 who had a CDI recurrence within 8 weeks of receiving CP101 or placebo; OR 2) adults with recurrent CDI who are eligible for direct study entry into CP101-CDI-E02. Subjects who are experiencing recurrent CDI will undergo screening procedures. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be eligible to be enrolled in he study and administered CP101. Approximately 200 subjects will receive CP101. The treatment duration will be 1 day. Subjects will be monitored for recurrence of CDI, safety, and tolerability for 24 weeks following receipt of CP101. The primary efficacy and safety endpoints will be evaluated at 8 weeks post treatment, and all subjects will continue to be followed for an additional 16 weeks for safety and recurrence of CDI.
