Ideas must be your own, and content must be exclusive to us (please don’t recycle content you have already created elsewhere). What makes something a fit for CBC Parents? ? REPRESENTATION Will it make someone who is underrepresented in parenting media feel included and represented? Is it a story that you haven't seen before that you think needs to be told? ? TONE Is it real and authentic? Is it conversational and relatable? ? CONTENT Will it make Canadian caregivers feel supported or celebrated? Does it help solve a problem many caregivers have? Or is it simply a whole lot of fun? If you can answer yes to at least one of these questions, then it could be a great fit!
