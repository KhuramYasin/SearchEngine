This attention partly comes from the knowledge that a showâ€™s main characters could die at any moment. Earlier this year, 15 million viewers watched the series finale of â€œLine of Duty,â€? a police procedural that killed off a central character early in its first season, and then another in the first episode of the second. This made it the most watched episode of British television drama of the 21st century so far, based on ratings for the first seven days of a showâ€™s availability. In 2018, 14 million people watched the finale of â€œBodyguard,â€? a political thriller which unexpectedly lost a key character, according to data from PA, a news agency. And the BBCâ€™s latest offering, â€œVigil,â€? a drama investigating a mysterious death on a nuclear submarine looks set to continue this trend, attracted double-digit-millions of viewers to its first episode, according to the BBC. Set to air on the U.S. streaming service Peacock later this year, itâ€™s fair to say â€œVigilâ€? is also full of unexpected twists and turns. Ratings like these in a country of 67 million people, combined with the dramasâ€™ critical success, recall the kind of appointment viewing not truly seen for network dramas in the United States since â€œGame of Thrones,â€? which ended in 2019 and also regularly killed off its most beloved characters. All airing on the BBC in Britain, â€œLine of Duty,â€? â€œBodyguardâ€? and â€œVigilâ€? were also all made by the same British production company, World Productions, based in London. Producers there realized that engaging viewers enough to keep them tuning in week after week meant defying some of the expectations of the longstanding British crime genre, according to Simon Heath, the companyâ€™s creative director.

Heath said in a video interview. But â€œas soon as you introduce an element of threat to the characters, the potential that they could be killed early, the audience then go looking for it everywhere,â€? he added. â€œSo everyone is on edge.â€? Much of the viewership for these dramas is live, in part because there is no option to binge current seasons in one go. Episodes are available only on the BBCâ€™s streaming service once they have already aired on TV, and teasers of upcoming episodes keep viewers guessing about future plot points. As a result, nearly 13 million people watched the â€œLine of Dutyâ€? finale the night it aired, and more than half of the 10 million viewers who watched the first episode of â€œVigilâ€? in its first week saw it the same day it was broadcast. Streaming services often drop seasons all at once â€” a trend that Netflix started with â€œHouse of Cardsâ€? and has continued with other tense dramas like â€œOzarkâ€? and â€œMindhunter.â€? â€œBodyguardâ€? also made a big splash when its six episodes arrived in bingeable form on Netflix in the United States, earning Richard Madden a Golden Globe for his lead performance. For legacy networks with their own streaming services, like HBO, thereâ€™s evidence it may still pay to make people wait. Earlier this year, HBOâ€™s popular â€œMare of Easttownâ€? aired on a weekly basis, with its finale becoming the most-watched original episode on HBO Max. (The night it aired, the finale of â€œMareâ€? drew 4 million views across HBOâ€™s platforms; by comparison, the â€œGame of Thronesâ€? finale was watched by nearly 14 million people the night it aired.) In addition to giving some breathing space for all that tension after each episode, airing episodes weekly means British viewers have the opportunity to obsessively dissect and discuss the plots between each episode, as media outlets publish their own theories of what might happen next. â€œShrine of Duty,â€? a podcast hosted by Rebecca Shekleton, Hannah Oâ€™Connell and Brendan Oâ€™Loughlin, dissects the complex plot points of â€œLine of Dutyâ€? scene-by-scene to spot hidden clues. â€œItâ€™s made a much bigger event out of the show by it all not being available to binge in one go and people having to wait week by week,â€? said Oâ€™Loughlin in a Zoom interview. These dramas all contain complex writing and interwoven plots that contain multiple theories of culpability, fueling the debate and intrigue. â€œYou need six days to sort of build on that, before you get the next little bit,â€? Oâ€™Connell said. The pandemic may also have fueled this appointment-to-view culture. â€œOne of the things I felt, last year, in the pandemic, was that people were missing communal social experiences,â€? Heath said. â€œAnd one of the very few ways that we could replicate that was by watching television programs at the same time.â€? While these popular crime dramas have different writers (â€œLine of Dutyâ€? and â€œBodyguardâ€? were written and created by Jed Mercurio, â€œVigilâ€? by Tom Edge), the team at World Productions wants the narratives for all their series to evolve organically during the writing process, Heath said. Rather than map out a full season at the beginning of production, Mercurio gives the editorial teams on his shows an outline for the first script, Heath said, and â€œthen basically Jed writes one episode at a time.â€? â€œWe read the outline and we give feedback, but in a way, weâ€™re behaving in the way that an audience would watch it for the first time,â€? Heath said. â€œWe donâ€™t know whatâ€™s coming.â€? As a result, he added, â€œyouâ€™re never in danger of signposting the story.â€?

Wenger said. The dramas are intrinsically linked by the fact that they explore public institutions that can feel somewhat opaque to the general public. â€œLine of Dutyâ€? is about a fictional police unit dedicated to ousting police corruption, â€œBodyguardâ€? explores the ethics around domestic government surveillance, and â€œVigilâ€? explores the balance between national security and public accountability. â€œThe Navy is not going to give you a tour around a submarine or tell you about all their mistakes, the near misses theyâ€™ve had over the last 30 years,â€? Heath said. â€œThe large majority of the incidents that happened during the series of â€˜Vigil,â€™ you could probably find real world correlatives if you look hard enough.â€? Each show also features relatable characters who are usually fighting a cause in the public interest. â€œThey offer the opportunity to explore a kind of moral complexity and moral grayness,â€? Wenger said. â€œThey also offer the opportunity to explore distrust in the establishment and authority, and the power of one or two individuals to resist that.â€? â€œI think that is something that feels very much a part of the national mood,â€? he added.
