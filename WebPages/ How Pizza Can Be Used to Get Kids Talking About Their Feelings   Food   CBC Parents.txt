You can try flash cards to offer visual cues, but this idea is a little bit tastier. Not only are these little pizzas easy to make, but they will help guide you through conversations about feelings! Which is nice. To begin, start with visuals of different kinds of expression — anything that demonstrates happy, sad, angry, anxious and anything else you can think of. The simpler the visual the better, because next you're going to ask your little ones to help you recreate how they feel on their very own pita pizza. This idea was inspired by The Story Store episode titled The Lonely Pizza, which you can listen to as you make these delicious treats — tune in here. What you need small pita or naan rounds pizza sauce of your choice toppings — we used fresh vegetables and cheese, but you can use whatever your family loves How it's made First you're going to preheat your oven to 350?. Warming up? OK, now take the lead on chopping the veggies and other toppings you'll want to use. Set them aside. Don't worry about keeping the pieces uniform, because no two faces are alike! This will also let little ones have more control over customizing their pie! Next, spoon some sauce on top. Lookin' saucy, pizza! Pick a cheese of choice that melts well — dairy, non-dairy — and sprinkle a little or a lot on top of the sauce. And now gather your toppings because it's time to make a face! This is a lonely pie because it's inspired by The Lonely Pizza, but your little ones will have fun making a whole variety of faces. We tried red pepper for the mouth, orange pepper for the nose and green pepper for the eyes. And then there's some mushroom eyebrows and spinach hair. Once the kiddos have finished arranging their pizza face how they'd like it, it's your turn to pop it into the oven for eight minutes. Once it's done baking — the cheese is melted and bubbling, but not burning — then take it out of the oven and let it cool for a minute. Then it's time to enjoy! And remember, emotions aren't singular and people feel many emotions at once. That just means more talking and more pizza! New to The Story Store? No problem! You can listen to all of season one here! And season two just started! Share You might also like No related entries found. You might also like No related entries found.
