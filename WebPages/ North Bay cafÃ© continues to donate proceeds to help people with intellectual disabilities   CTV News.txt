Nov.20/21 (Eric Taschner/CTV News Northern Ontario) NORTH BAY - There are many restaurants and cafÃ©s in North Bay that are rebounding from the COVID-19 pandemic. At the Home Style CafÃ©, the grill is sizzling, the line is long and the food is dished out to hungry diners. The cafÃ© is thrilled to see its customers come back. Thatâ€™s because itâ€™s operated by Community Living North Bay and all of the proceeds go back to supporting the organizationâ€™s programs and services for people with intellectual disabilities. â€œPeople are really happy,â€? said manager Lisette Nault. â€œWe are open to the community. Itâ€™s a great feeling. Itâ€™s pretty heart warming knowing the people we support really appreciate it.â€? The cafÃ© opened in 1989 as a training centre for Community Living North Bay. Once the province passed Bill 148, it had to undergo changes to become a not-for-profit restaurant instead. The restaurant is looking at eventually hiring more that come out from Community Living North Bayâ€™s employment program. â€œThat is a long-term goal to hire people with intellectual disabilities,â€? said Community Living North Bay Executive Director Sherry Carnevale. â€œThis is a gem that Community Living has.â€? Between 600-700 people use Community Living North Bay. It provides a wide range of programs from helping people find job to assisting children, their families and adults with disabilities. Community Living is in its 66th year. Some of its programs include: clinical services, respite, community transition programs, student nutrition programs and adult education. â€œWe work really hard in getting that message out for the community to see what we do,â€? said Carnevale. Officials credit the restaurant for helping those with disabilities get access to the services they need.
