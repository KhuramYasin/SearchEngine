Activity 1 7. Activity 2 More Introduction Symmetry is when one side of a shape is a mirror image of the other side. Lots of buildings and everyday objects use symmetry because it looks appealing to the human eye. But, if you step outside, into a garden, park or even the grounds at your school, you can also find symmetry in nature. to-topBack to top Finding symmetry in nature Join Hannah and Maya as they meet up with Angela at Backwell Lake in North Somerset to look for symmetry around them. to-topBack to top Reflective symmetry A 2D shape is symmetrical if you can draw a line through the middle of it and either side is a reflection of the other. There is a very famous example of symmetry in nature - the butterfly. The dotted line down the middle is called a line of symmetry or mirror line, because if you place a mirror along it, the reflection looks exactly the same as the original. This kind of symmetry is called reflective symmetry. It's not just in butterfly wings that you can see reflective symmetry, have a look through the slideshow below to see some other examples. previous next Barn owl You can see symmetry in the face of animals.1 of 3 previous next Leaves Or in the leaves on the ground or in the trees.2 of 3 previous next Reflections You can always find symmetry in the reflections in water.3 of 3 Remember, a line of symmetry doesnâ€™t always have to go from top to bottom and some shapes can have multiple lines of symmetry. Can you think of any examples? to-topBack to top Rotational symmetry Symmetry isnâ€™t always about mirrors and reflections. Look at this spiderâ€™s web. It is the same whichever way round you look at it. previous next Spider web Often when you look at a spider's web, they are the same whichever way round you look at them.1 of 2 previous next Snowflakes The same goes for snowflakes up close in the winter. they show rotational symmetry.2 of 2 This kind of symmetry is called rotational symmetry. Rotational symmetry is where a shape or pattern can be rotated or turned around a point and it looks the same. to-topBack to top Lesson complete! Well done Regenerator, you've completed this lesson.
