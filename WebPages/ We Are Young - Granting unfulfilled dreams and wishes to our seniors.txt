Holiday Happiness Cards WE ARE YOUNG Granting Unfulfilled Wishes to Our Seniors We Are Young is a charitable organization that grants unfulfilled wishes to seniors living in Nova Scotia. We grant unfulfilled wishes to seniors with the clear intention of changing the way society views and values our oldest generation. Through granting wishes, our mission is to raise social awareness around the inequalities our seniors face, encourage respect for and appreciation of seniors, and facilitate inter-generational connection where our seniors experience inclusion and belonging in our communities. 0 Wishes Granted 0 Active Volunteers 0 Little Wishes Granted 0 220 Donors “Chase Your Dreams, whatever you want to do, and you’ll get there.” Alfred Myra , 92 â€œAlzheimerâ€™s disease has taken a lot from my father. This experience gave something back. Thank you for that.â€? Stuart’s Son â€œNever in my wildest dreams did I ever expect that I would go back to Amethyst Cove. I will never say I am too old.â€? Victor Althiem, 78 WAY’s Holiday Happiness Cards WAY has kicked off its Holiday Happiness Card campaign. This year, we partnered with our friends at Halifax Paper Hearts who designed our beautiful holiday cards.Â For every $7.50 donation, WAY will gift one of our holiday cards to an anonymous senior in your community. These cards will all be handwritten out by our volunteers, and then shipped out to anonymous seniors throughout Nova Scotia before December 20th! Although the holiday’s are a time for celebration, it is also when feelings of loneliness and isolation are at an all time high for many, especially seniors. We know from experience that the impact of knowing someone is thinking of them during this season, is unmatched. Consider making a $7.50 donation today in order to help help us reach our goal to deliver 2,000 handwritten cards to our seniors.
