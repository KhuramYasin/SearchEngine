My goodness, another very wet and foggy flight. 1. Norway's Preikstolen ("Pulpit Rock") is a flattish, square-ish table-top rock which juts out over Lysefjord. People hike for two hours to sit with their feet dangling over the edge of a sheer 600-metre drop. Honestly, it makes parts of my anatomy shrivel up whenever I see a picture of it. You might have seen this huge rock in "Mission Impossible - Fallout" or the TV series "Vikings". Amazingly, there has only been one fatal fall from it. 2. Leaving Denmark to head out over the expanse of sea known as the Skagerrak. This connects the North Sea to the Kattegat Sea. 3. The sun shines on the righteous over the Skaggerak! 4. A beautiful double rainbow on the way to Kristiansand. Sights like this make it worth the trouble to elect to use real weather all the time. 5. Kristiansand Arena, the 15,000 capacity home of the mighty IK Start football club. 6. At this point, I mucked up the nav computer. I could see it was going to take me to a nav point other than Preikstolen, so I fiddled with the Garmin, activated the Preikstolen leg...Â and it went loopy, and swung us the wrong way. From here on, it was a mix of visual flight rules and checking the GPS map. Which meant flying up a fjord in thick fog, whilst trying to get low enough to see Preikstolen. 7. Diving down to the city of Stavanger. 8. Viking Stadion, home of the mighty Viking FK, founded here in 1899. They are one of Norway's best teams, having won their league and cup many times. They knocked Chelsea out of the UEFA Cup in 2002, by banging four goals past them here. 9. A satisfactory manual landing. The red and white precision approach path indicator lights on the runway's left were hugely helpful (they tell you whether you're too high or low). 10.
