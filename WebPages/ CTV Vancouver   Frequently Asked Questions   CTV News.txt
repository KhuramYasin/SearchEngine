Q: Why did CTV change the time/day that my favourite program airs? A change in time or day of when your favourite program airs may be related to a network change, an audience profile adjustment, or a programming conflict with another current CTV show. Q: Will my program/episode be repeated? From time to time programs and episodes may be repeated. While we understand this may be frustrating for viewers it is important to keep in mind that most prime time series only produce between 22 and 24 episodes per year -- necessitating repeats at some point throughout the season. Repeated episodes also give viewers a chance to catch up on episodes they might have missed. Please check the program list at www.ctv.ca or your TV Listings. Q. Why does the TV listing not match with what you aired? We hate when that happens, just as much as you do. The printing deadlines are often several days out and we were unable to make a late programming change to the print media. For your most current CTV program schedule, please check program list at www.ctv.ca. Q: How do I turn off a voice on my television that describes the action shown on the program? What you are hearing is called Descriptive Video (DV). This service is helps visually impaired viewers better understand what is on their screens, similar to closed captioning for the hearing impaired. Descriptive Video can be turned on or off through your television by adjusting the Secondary Audio Program (SAP). You may have to consult your television manual to access this feature.
