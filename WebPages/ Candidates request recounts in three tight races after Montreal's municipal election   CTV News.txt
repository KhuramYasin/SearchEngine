Recounts have also been officially requested in two other tight races following the Nov. 7 election. Incumbent John Belvedere is asking for the results in Pointe-Claire to be looked at again after losing the election by just 61 votes. He has now hired a lawyer to challenge the results. â€œEveryone needs to know where everybody stands and democracy is the most overriding consideration of everything weâ€™re talking about here,â€? said lawyer Michael Polak in an interview Thursday. Both Belvedere and Thomas declined CTV Newsâ€™ requests for interviews. Pointe-Claire has seen its share of contentious issues, starting with the development of condos at the site of the former Old Pioneer bar â€” something that was on the mind of voters at the ballot box. â€œI donâ€™t think we want Pointe-Claire to become the downtown of the West Island,â€? one voter told CTV. However, she says a recount is the right move. â€œI think there should be a recount because with 61 votes and I understand a lot of spoiled votes.â€? Belvedereâ€™s lawyer expects an answer from the court soon. â€œYou have a difference of 61 votes between the 2 top contenders Mr. Thomas and Mr. Belvedere and 55 spoiled ballots,â€? Polak said. But even he points out being granted a recount is far from a slam dunk. â€œWhen you are asking a judge he or she has the final word. And you never know what a judge is going to think or say, never assume anything,â€? he said. â€œThis is the court of law and the judge has the last word.â€? With the contenders hoping the last word comes in the next few days, Pointe-Claire's next council meeting is set for Tuesday. RECOUNTS REQUESTED IN OUTREMONT, TÉTREAULTVILLE On Thursday afternoon, a spokesperson for Mayor Valerie Plante's Projet Montreal confirmed to CTV that it will request a judicial recount in two close races won by just a few dozen votes. Her party's candidate in the Tétreaultville district, Suzie Miron, lost by 42 votes to Ensemble Montreal's Julien Hénault-Ratelle. The party is also challenging the results in the race for mayor of Outremont. In that race, Laurent Desbois of Ensemble Montreal won by a margin of 23 votes against Philipe Tomlinson.
