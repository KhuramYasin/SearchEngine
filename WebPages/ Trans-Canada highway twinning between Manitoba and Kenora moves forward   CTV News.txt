Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation, and Greg Rickford, Minister of Indigenous Affairs, announced the details on Friday. â€œToday we signed two contracts with Indigenous partners for early works to produce the raw materials needed to build the road base and for clearing work, including tree and brush removal, within the new right of way for the first section of the Highway 17 twinning,â€? the pair wrote in a statement. â€œThis milestone will position us to get shovels in the ground for this section of the highway as soon as the spring.â€? Ontario announced plans to twin the highway in 2020. On Nov. 9, the province announced it would train 110 Indigenous workers for construction jobs on the project. â€œOur duty to consult is one we take seriously, and we will continue to work collaboratively with local Indigenous communities,â€? the statement said. -With files from CTVâ€™s Jeff Keele.
