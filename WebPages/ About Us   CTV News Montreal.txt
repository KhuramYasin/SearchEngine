Known to generations of Montrealers by its call letters CFCF, it was the first private TV station in the province, and in 2021, celebrated its 60th anniversary! The station launched on January 20, 1961 and was one of the founding partners in the CTV network. From that day on it has been the top-rated English television station in the province. Its award-winning flagship newscast, CTV News at 6, is hosted by veteran news anchor Mutsumi Takahashi, who has held the position for more than three decades. In 2016, she was honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Radio Television Digital News Association of Canada. In 2018 she was awarded the Order of Canada. Â The station prides itself on its close connection to the community, with on-air personalities and other staff members committed to a wide range of charitable activities and community work.
