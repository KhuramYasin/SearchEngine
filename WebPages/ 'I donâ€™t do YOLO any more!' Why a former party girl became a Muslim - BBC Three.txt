Why a former party girl became a Muslim Persephone Rizvi used to spend the weekends partying hard, but she was miserable. As part of a new documentary for BBC Three she reveals how Islam helped save her life 18 November 2021 Real Life Share this: Copy this linkRead more about sharing As a teenager, I was like a bull in a china shop. Weekends were all about partying. Back in those days, the weekend would’ve gone like this: whose ID are we using? What outfit am I wearing? Then it would be the pre-drinks, then who’s taking us to town? The party wouldn’t stop until four or five AM in the club, then it would be on to a house party afterwards, then waking up with a hangover. I remember getting into fights with girls and having cigarettes flicked at me. But it got too much. Things had to change. I was using alcohol as my coping mechanism and going through emotionally-draining experiences that I couldn’t really make sense of. I was struggling to see a purpose in my life and I wanted to do better for myself. I didn’t know what I was doing. So I became a Muslim. 'I burst into the house like, I’m Muslim now!' The summer before I went to university, I had a summer job in a call centre. One of my friends there, Haleemah, was Muslim. I did the Ramadan fast with her, and that was my first exposure to Islam. I wasn’t thinking about joining a religion at that point – it was more of a personal challenge. My ego was saying, ‘it’s 30 days of fasting, I can do that’. When I first fasted I was still partying and drinking, but my attitude started to change. I started having these moments of, ‘I am better than this, I’m worth more’. That month of abstinence made me feel a sense of selflessness and gratitude, and gave me the self-care package I needed so desperately. That was my calling card to Islam. BBC I grew up going to Sunday school. My parents wanted me and my sister to have an understanding of faith. My dad is Black British and went to (a Christian) church, and my mum wanted us to have a knowledge of faith, but they didn’t force it on us. There aren’t any practicing Muslims in my family. During my first year at uni, I was seriously researching Islam and considering becoming a Muslim. I was back and forth between university in Salford and my parents’ house in Huddersfield, but they didn’t know the extent of my interest in Islam. I kept it pretty under wraps until one day I burst into the house with my headscarf on like, ‘I’m Muslim now!’ My parents were shocked and confused, but they weren’t unhappy. They questioned my choices a lot and wanted to ensure I was making the right decision. My dad thought I was quite overzealous and when I look back I wasn’t very moderate – I wanted to do everything by the book without understanding the interpretation of the Quran properly. I wanted to go hard and do everything with conviction. 'Men don’t bother me now I wear a headscarf' That meant I threw away bags of clothes I didn’t think were appropriate any more, removed my false stiletto nails, changed my name on social media, deleted lots of racy photos and created a new Facebook page so nobody could see me. I thought all those Western clothes were haram (forbidden in Islam). I felt like I couldn’t be around anyone drinking alcohol, and I wouldn’t go to places where it would be mixed sex. At that point, I was very private about my journey into religion and didn’t like questions on it. I’ve chilled out now – if a friend wants to have a drink, I don’t kick up a fuss, it’s their choice ultimately. In the Muslim community, people have individual opinions and boundaries on whether they're happy to be around alcohol or how to dress, but even now, I change my headscarf style to cover my chest more if there’ll be a lot of men around. I feel more comfortable. I can get from A to B without anyone stopping me – the way I used to dress, I used to get stopped loads. On a ten-minute walk to uni I got stopped about five times. Men now don’t bother me at all! I’m not saying these were the wrong decisions but they didn’t come with time – I jumped straight into it. And that also meant I felt like the friends I knew didn’t fit into my world any more. I felt like I was Muslim and striving a certain lifestyle, but they weren’t. BBC Persephone Rizvi I was still at uni when I took my Shahada (the oath you take when you officially become a Muslim). I didn’t plan it, but I went to Eccles Mosque in Salford with a list of questions for the imam. He answered them, and said, ‘repeat after me…’ so I did, and then he was like, ‘Congratulations, you’re Muslim now!’ I was so overwhelmed, but delighted that I’d finally done it. The Muslim community welcomed me in so much. I’ve met a few friends for life through Islam – they reminded me of what sisterhood is supposed to be. We can talk to each other with no filter, we’re honest with our guards down and we’re each other’s solace when times get tough. My friends are my strongest support system and I’ve come to learn that over the years nothing matters more than the people you keep around you. 'I tried to end my life' The girls you see in the film, Twaheeda and Reema, are literally my sounding board and my ticket to Heaven. They remind me all the time that this life is not our final resting place. YOLO doesn’t really work for me anymore if it equates to reckless behaviour! I didn’t get everything right. I have relapsed a few times and drunk alcohol when my mental state went downhill but that was very early in my reversion, it’s not happened for a long time now. My determination to bounce back and do better won every time. And now I don’t even think twice about being tempted – the risk of relapsing feels far gone. It’s okay to not get everything right, it doesn’t mean I’m not committed to the religion. My parents are super supportive – they’ve actually fasted with me a few times. Their main concern was that I wasn’t going to be me any more, but as they’ve seen over the years, I’m still me, just version two! More respectful, at peace, kind to myself and conscious of the world and how my actions impact others. I think my mum’s actually enjoyed challenging herself to find what I consider modest fashion for me. She’s always been my personal stylist and my Muslim friends can’t believe my outfits are literally pulled from my mum’s wardrobe and then layered up to fit with my modest clothing! I revisited Greenhead Park in Huddersfield, where I've had some really good times there, but some really hard times too. When my mental health got really bad, I tried to end my life in the park. Getting drunk led me to a lot of dark places. It was after a really bad episode of waking up naked on the kitchen floor that I knew I had to make a change. I’d passed out from drinking too much. It felt hellish. That’s why I say Islam saved me, because now I know the best way for me to handle those dark times. I wouldn’t have coped this way, by praying and taking care of my mental health as well as physical, if it wasn’t for Islam.
