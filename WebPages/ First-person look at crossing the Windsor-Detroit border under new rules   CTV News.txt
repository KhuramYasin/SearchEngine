Garton did his research before entering the Detroit Windsor Tunnel to ensure he had all of the federal requirements for crossing, such as proof of vaccination and a PCR test for his return to Canada. Hereâ€™s a first-person look at his day trip: Crossing the U.S. border 101: on top of double vaccination, you must get a negative PCR TEST before re-entering Canada. I chose the â€œtest before you leaveâ€? option, which means I need to be back in Canada by 5:26 p.m. (72 hours from time of my Friday test). @CTVWindsor #pcrtest pic.twitter.com/RfILKCDuGA â€” Rich Garton (@RichGartonCTV) November 8, 2021 Windsor Top Stories BREAKING BREAKING | Police: 'Some fatalities' when SUV hits Wisconsin Christmas parade 'Iâ€™m just thankful Iâ€™m alive': Harrow woman ready to return home after ATV crash $100K attic fire in Windsor, Ont. $30K Sunday morning fire in Windsor London defeats Windsor for OFC Championship Ontario reports 741 new COVID-19 cases and 3 more deaths Christmas tree shortage expected in wake of B.C. flooding 'I have personally experienced a great deal of transphobia': Transgender Day of Remembrance and Resilience Search CTV News Advertise on CTVNews.ca Political Ads Registry About CTV Careers CTV News Stox Press Room Editorial Standards & Policies Contact Us CTV News Programs CTV National News Power Play W5 CTV Question Period Pop Life Local News AtlanticBarrieCalgary EdmontonGuelphKitchener LethbridgeLondonMontreal Northern OntarioOttawa Prince AlbertRed DeerRegina SaskatoonToronto VancouverVancouver Island WindsorWinnipegYorkton CTV News App Video Help Stay up to date on the latest, breaking news Subscribe to newsletter Â© 2021 All rights reserved.
