It is a format/language, which displays information or content available on a web site. It is used for distributing news headlines and other regularly updated web content. How it works With RSS a Web site can allow other sites to publish its content by creating a special document called an “RSS feed”. Other Webmasters can then post a link to the rss feed on their site so users can read the distributed content. This system allows the syndication of lists of hyperlinks, along with other information, or metadata, that helps viewers decide whether they want to follow the link. RSS allows a person’s computer to fetch and understand the information, so that all of the lists that person is interested in can be tracked and personalized for them.
