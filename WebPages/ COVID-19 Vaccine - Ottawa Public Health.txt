Mobile vaccine clinic request Beginning July 22, 2021, Ottawa Public Health is expanding the way that residents can access the COVID-19 vaccine. Workplaces, community organizations, places of worship and other groups can now request a mobile vaccination team to administer first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine on-site, at their own location. This program is intended to help reduce barriers for residents who have not yet received the vaccine by working with community leaders to provide comfortable, convenient and easily accessible options for vaccination. This is just one more initiative to help ensure that anyone born in 2009 or earlier in Ottawa who wants the COVID-19 vaccine can get vaccinated.
