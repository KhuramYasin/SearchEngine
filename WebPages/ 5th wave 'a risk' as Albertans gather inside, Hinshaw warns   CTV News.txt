In her COVID-19 update on Tuesday, Dr. Deena Hinshaw said there is a â€œrisk we could see a fifth waveâ€? due to the â€œseasonality of the virus.â€? â€œTransmission increases when we have people who are infectious coming in contact with people who are susceptible to the virus and the greater the number of contacts between people especially in indoor locations,â€? she explained. Hinshaw said Albertans â€œhave the toolsâ€? needed to help mitigate the â€œaggressive natureâ€? of transmitting COVID-19, in particular the Delta variant. Some of those tools include regular hand washing, getting vaccinated, staying home when sick, masking when indoors and avoiding crowded rooms with poor ventilation. â€œThe more of us that participate in the multi layers of protection, the less the chance of a fifth wave that could increase the strain on our health-care system this winter,â€? she said. Hinshaw told media she does not anticipate further restrictions in the coming months if people continue to follow the guidelines. â€œWeâ€™re in a bit of a plateau but we are still slowly declining.â€? Dr. Noel Gibey, professor emeritus, department of critical care medicine at the University of Alberta, said itâ€™s critical for the province to watch whatâ€™s playing out around the world, in particular northern Europe because their vaccination rate is higher. â€œTheyâ€™ve had a huge wave recently by virtue of the 10 per cent that are not vaccinated plus the other individuals who got their vaccines more than six months ago and have break-through infections,â€? he explained. â€œItâ€™s very likely based on that alone we will see another outbreak at some point in the next two, three months.â€? COVID-19 booster shots are being offered to eligible Albertans, but Hinshaw has stressed the importance of waiting at least six months between the second and third vaccination to ensure long-term immunity. â€œWe donâ€™t want to waste vaccine protection by giving boosters too soon,â€? she said.
