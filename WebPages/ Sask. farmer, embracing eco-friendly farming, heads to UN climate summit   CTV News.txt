The summit, known as COP26 and delayed one year by COVID-19, is being held in Glasgow, Scotland. Itâ€™s intended to finalize the rule book for the Paris accord, including how carbon emissions trading can work between countries and what each country has to report about progress toward climate goals. The NFU delegates have observer status to watch the negotiations of state officials. They will also speak at the People's Climate Summit along with other civil society groups at the event. Wright says he hopes to gain more insight into climate action and upon his return he plans to continue to encourage change in agricultural practises and domestic behaviours. He says Canada should stick to its pledge, made under the Stephen Harper government, at the G20 Summit in 2009 to end all fossil fuel subsidies. Wright has taken steps to reduce his fossil fuel use. He uses solar panels and drives electric vehicles. He has also reduced the amount of fertilizer used on fields by doing intercropping where he seeds canola with pulse crops or perennial forage cover like alfalfa. â€œThatâ€™s taking nitrogen and making it bio-available for plants so I donâ€™t have to use nitrogen fertilizers made with the use of natural gas,â€? said Wright.

Thankfully Iâ€™ve been switching to minimum input farming,â€? said Wright. Agricultural emissions make up 24 per cent of all emissions in Saskatchewan, according to the province. The oil and gas industry emissions are estimated at 30 per cent with electricity generation at 20 per cent. â€œWe need to tackle industrial pollution with much more vigor then focusing on residential individual actions,â€? said Wright.
