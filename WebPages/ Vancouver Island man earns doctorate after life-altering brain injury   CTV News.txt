Before this journey began, Brian was an infantryman preparing for what became the first Gulf War. During training, he says he was almost killed in a crash. â€œI was in the back of the vehicle,â€? Brian says. â€œI was thrown out of the hatch.â€? Although he has no memory of what happened, Brian says there was no doubt about the life-altering damage to his body, including his brain. â€œThereâ€™s all these doctors telling me, â€˜Brian youâ€™re going to be OK, but youâ€™ll never be academically competitive.â€™â€? Brian remembers being told. â€œâ€˜This is your new normal and you should be okay with that because thereâ€™s nothing you can do about it.â€™â€? Although Brian felt crushed, he accepted the diagnosis and began living his â€œlimitedâ€? life. â€œI worked minimum wage jobs. I spent time [being] poor,â€? Brian says. â€œEven though I was working [full-time], about five days a month I didnâ€™t have enough food to eat.â€? He also felt hungry to learn more, and eventually started taking night classes. â€œI donâ€™t care if I pass or not,â€? Brian remembers thinking. â€œIâ€™m just going to go learn about things that are interesting to me.â€? Brian says he would eventually pass the courses, despite his many challenges. â€œI had difficulties remembering my name,â€? Brian says. â€œI would randomly pass out.â€? Later, he befriended a chemical engineer named Deja who saw the intelligence behind Brianâ€™s struggles. â€œFor the first time in my life somebody did better than me,â€? Deja says. â€œAnd I graduated with honours.â€? They eventually married and Deja encouraged Brian to compile his decades worth of night courses into a bachelor's degree, and pursue a Masters. â€œI only applied because I knew I wouldnâ€™t get it,â€? Brian smiles. â€œAnd she would stop hounding me.â€? But Royal Roads University accepted him. â€œOh no! Now Iâ€™m going into this thing I canâ€™t do,â€? Brian recalls thinking. â€œI maybe made a mistake.â€? It wasnâ€™t a mistake. Brian not only completed his Masters, he recently earned a Doctorate. Itâ€™s a once unthinkable accomplishment that he credits with neuroplasticity (the brainâ€™s ability to reorganize itself) and Dejaâ€™s unwavering support. â€œI want to build a life where we leave each other better than we found each other,â€? Deja says. And Brian wants others with similar challenges to never give up on the ride of their lives. â€œI donâ€™t think Iâ€™m special. I still have issues,â€? Brian says. â€œBut if you try really hard, youâ€™ll end up with something remarkable.â€?
