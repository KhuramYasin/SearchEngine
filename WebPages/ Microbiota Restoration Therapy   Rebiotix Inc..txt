This new and swiftly expanding field continues to underscore the powerful connection between the human microbiome and health, and how restoring disrupted microbiomes, particularly those of the human gut, may be needed to combat challenging diseases1. Driven to help people live better lives Through strong science and careful clinical evaluation, we aim to develop microbiota-based live biotherapeutics that bring the potential of the human microbiome to the patients and physicians who need them most. In 2018, Rebiotix joined Ferring Pharmaceuticals, a globally-recognized specialty pharmaceutical company driven to help people live better lives. Combined with their history and passion for microbiome-based research, our ability to make microbiota-based live biotherapeutics may soon be a reality. The Leader in Developing Microbiota-Based Therapies through the MRTâ„¢ Drug Platform The MRT platform is our technology for developing formulations consisting of live, human-derived microbes. We have the most advanced human clinical program with extensive clinical trial experience in multiple indications, evaluating an investigative microbiota-based live biotherapeutic drug. Our research, conducted in coordination with regulatory authorities, encompasses studies with acute and chronic disease states through both company- and physician-sponsored trials. Check out our clinical program, including our advanced investigative programs for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection, for more information.
