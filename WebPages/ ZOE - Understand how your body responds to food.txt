Dr. Tim Spector Scientific Co-Founder, ZOE Professor of Genetic Epidemiology, Kingâ€™s College London Discover more science Discover more science Science How does the gut influence dietary inflammation & metabolism? From our research, we can see that the food you eat influences the bacteria in your gut. We also see that certain foods and overall diet are linked to â€˜good' or â€˜bad' gut bacteria that can help or hinder your metabolic health. Eating the right foods to balance these bacteria may improve your bodies' response to food â€“ reducing harmful dietary inflammation. Science What is dietary inflammation? We use the term â€˜dietary inflammation' to capture the unhealthy effects that can be triggered in the hours after eating the â€˜wrong' foods for our biology. Repeated over time, excessive blood sugar and fat responses can trigger a variety of negative short- and long-term health outcomes. Our studies suggest â€˜good' gut bacteria can provide a protective effect, reducing these negative responses and supporting lower levels of body fat.
