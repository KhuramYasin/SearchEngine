Our work is centered around four core activities: Conservation We dedicate our efforts to conserve an invisible and crucial biodiversity for humans: the gut microbiome. By culturing, isolating and storing gut bacteria, we are building an open, non-profit and global library of our microbial heritage. Learn More Representation We are strongly committed in working with a wide variety of human populations worldwide, especially indigenous peoples and other under-represented communities, to promote inclusion in microbiome science. Participants retain the ownership of their microbiomes. Learn More Capacity Building Our global consortium promotes capacity building in partner institutions through scientific training and local research support. Learn More Advancing knowledge We generate microbiome resources for the research community to advance science and promote human health. Using these resources we will tackle big scientific questions on the human microbiome. We engage in outreach and educational activities to promote the objectives of the GMbC and spread knowledge on the microbiome.
