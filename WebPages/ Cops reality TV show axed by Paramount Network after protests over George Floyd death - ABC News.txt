"Cops is not on the Paramount Network and we don't have any current or future plans for it to return," a spokesperson for the cable channel said in a statement. The show had been pulled temporarily from the air in late May, when protests aimed at police over the death of George Floyd began to gain momentum. That move was made permanent on June 10. Loading It's not clear whether the company that makes the show, Langley Productions, would try to find a new home for it. The show, with its widely known reggae theme song Bad Boys, allowed viewers to ride along with police officers on patrol in various US cities. It ran on the Fox network for 25 years until 2013, when Viacom-owned Spike TV picked it up. The show remained on air after Spike was re-branded as the Paramount Network in 2018.
