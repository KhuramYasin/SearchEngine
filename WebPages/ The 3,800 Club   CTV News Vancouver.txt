I am one of them." When CTV News Vancouver anchor and Fraser Valley bureau chief Michele Brunoro was diagnosed, she did what she's done for much of her life: Started asking questions. "What stage of cancer? What are the survival rates? Has it spread? The poor doctor. I must have exhausted her! I needed answers and this deadline was far more crucial than my usual rush to get a story on the six oâ€™clock news," Michele wrote. She braced herself for surgery, grappled with breaking the news to her children, and met with survivors. Now, she's sharing her journey with breast cancer. Blog posts The 3,800 Club: 21,000 breast cancer screenings lost to the pandemic The pandemic has meant screening programs for breast, cervical and colon cancer for non-symptomatic people have stopped. For breast screenings alone, thatâ€™s 21,000 screenings that didnâ€™t happen in just the first month of shut-downs. The 3,800 Club: One year since I started chemo, and so much has changed Even as my heart goes out to those going through treatment amid COVID-19, I feel in some ways that the lessons I learned during my cancer journey helped prepare me for this pandemic. The 3,800 Club: COVID-19 and cancer patients I have been thinking of you. And I have been thinking about your fight against cancer amid the COVID-19 crisis. The 3,800 Club: My first day back in the newsroom Itâ€™s my first day back at work in more than a year and it feels so â€œnormal." It feels like Iâ€™m getting another piece of my life back. The 3,800 Club: The best Christmas gift I could ask for Last week, my oncologist gave me the news I have been hoping so long to hear: there are no signs of cancer in me at all. It is the best Christmas gift I could receive. The 3,800 Club: Re-emerging from the 'mental fog' of chemo I knew there would be many physical changes during my chemotherapy treatments, but I wasn't expecting the cognitive ones. The 3,800 Club: A life-saving drug in short supply Itâ€™s a cancer drug given to thousands of patients in B.C. and right across the country, myself included. But Health Canada now says there's a national shortage of the medication. The 3,800 Club: All grown up and still giving back Brendan Whieldon was just five years old when I met him, and already in the fight of his life. The 3,800 Club: Uncomfortably numb I'm not bald anymore! But there are some other lingering side effects from my chemotherapy treatments. The 3,800 Club: I'm done chemo! Iâ€™m in the chemo room for my weekly ritual. On the surface, everything is routine. Same questions from my nurse. Same meds. And yet, this isnâ€™t just another treatment day. The 3,800 Club: The unique physio program helping breast cancer patients After surgery, I was surprised not only by how weak the arm on my surgery side had become but how much movement I had lost in it. Simple stretches had become incredibly difficult. The 3,800 Club: The case of the missing fingerprints It feels like something that could happen in a fictional spy or crime movie â€“ characters whose fingerprints vanish. The 3,800 Club: Saying goodbye to a friend My friend Sharon Zastowny died only about two months after being diagnosed with breast cancer. The 3,800 Club: Counting your blessings Reaching the halfway point in her chemotherapy treatments, CTV's Michele Brunoro reflects on all she's grateful for. The 3,800 Club: Exercising during chemotherapy I told myself before I began my treatment for breast cancer that as long as I was physically able, I would exercise every day on this journey. The 3,800 Club: An unexpected companion on my cancer journey Sometimes we luck out. Sometimes, we end up blessed with life-long friends. The 3,800 Club: A very prickly trade-off I donâ€™t like needles. I mean, who does? But when my oncologist says I can take a month off my chemo treatments for breast cancer if I give myself injections in my stomach, I do a fast attitude adjustment. The 3,800 Club: You are more than the hair on your head I can't wait to have a shoulder-length head of hair again. But I also know this: I am not defined by the hair on my head. The 3,800 Club: Will my hair really fall out? I suddenly like my hair. A lot. Itâ€™s the same head of hair I have wished so many times could look like someone elseâ€™s. The 3,800 Club: Dancing with the Red Devil I want to be strong. Fierce. But if I am honest with you, I am afraid in this moment.
