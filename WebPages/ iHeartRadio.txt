In the summer, you can find me puttering at the cottage, building a deck, or on the pontoon boat with family and most likely with a drink in my hand. I am a proud husband and father that loves spending time with my family skiing, sailing and travelling. Basically, I like to live my life like it’s a Kenny Chesney video.
