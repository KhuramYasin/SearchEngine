As the five teens try their hand at roles in workplaces as diverse as a car showroom and an oyster farm, their personalities have come to the fore just as much as their skillsets. It gave Stacey the opportunity to observe the situations the Nine to Fivers - Sam, Tillie, Bakr, Layla and Ellie - find themselves in, and the lessons they take from it. Hereâ€™s a taster of what Stacey had to say. Take the foot off the gasâ€¦ sometimes Sam showed off how competitive he could be when the group was sent to work at a car dealership. But that desire to be the first over the line was almost his undoing. Samâ€™s competitive streak led to a few hiccups with some tasks Stacey says: â€œAt the car dealership, he was speeding around the forecourt doing his checklist and bosses were standing back watching in amazement. He decided too that he wanted to â€˜winâ€™ over his teammate.â€? But as Sam moved through the different workplaces across the series, that â€˜winningâ€™ desire led to mistakes, some of which were costly to the businesses involved. Stacey adds: â€œSome tasks take a lot of time to master and some races arenâ€™t won by sprinting as fast as you can â€“ developing successfully in the workplace is a long game!â€?

Step out of that comfort zone As part of The Nine to Five, the teenagers involved can receive a payment equivalent to the national apprenticeship wage at the end of every shift. But itâ€™s not guaranteed - their performance dictates how much money they pocket. Tillie tried to stop expressing her opinions One person who learnt the hard way is Tillie. Keen on a future in politics, Tillie is used to sharing her opinions. However, she expressed concerns early on that this may be a problem in the workplace. She wanted to work on it - but it didnâ€™t quite go to plan. Stacey says: â€œShe went too far the other way. She ended up not saying what she really thought at the car dealership when Bakr and Sam were playing drums on the bonnet of a Â£40k car. â€œShe went on to regret that at payday when her wages were docked too.â€? Further experiences at the oyster farm and cheese factory saw Tillie involved in tasks more physical than she was used to. But after a stuttering start, she stepped away from her comfort zone and threw herself into the task at hand. Read more about Tillieâ€™s experiences here. Make me be your leader Stepping up to the plate for the first time can be daunting - and thatâ€™s what happened to Layla during The Nine to Five. Layla surprised herself with her leadership qualities Prior to her different work experiences, Layla had never taken the lead in tasks, and often needed reassurance that she was doing a good job. However, bosses observing the teenagers at work could see that she had potential. Her leadership skills just needed a little coaxing. â€œBosses were so impressed with Layla that on her second day they asked her to become the team supervisor of a major group task,â€? says Stacey. â€œThe group now looked to her to be told what to do and suddenly there was no boss to hold her hand through it. She had to trust her own judgement.â€? At first, Layla saw leadership as getting stuck in to a task herself. Then someone with more experience pointed out that delegating tasks was a big part of being a leader. Stacey adds: â€œOnce she understood that key difference, she took to supervising like a duck to water!â€? You can read more about Laylaâ€™s story here. Find your feet in your own way When Ellie signed up for The Nine to Five, it wasnâ€™t just about work experience. As a child, she had severe ME, an illness which prevented her from doing things so many of us take for granted, such as taking a shower or preparing a snack. The Nine to Five was a significant step for Ellie Ellie's health improved but she needed so much help from her family, especially her mum while she was unwell, she had become used to other people doing things for her. The Nine to Five was an opportunity to work at being independent. Stacey explains: â€œEllie came face-to-face with some hard situations and she wasnâ€™t always confident that she could tackle it. But with a brief visit from mum to spur her along, Ellie realised that she didnâ€™t have to transform into a completely independent adult overnight.â€? Find out more about Ellieâ€™s story here. Perfection is practically impossible â€œItâ€™s important to accept the little imperfect bumps that happen in the road,â€? says Stacey, â€œbecause theyâ€™re inevitable and you can learn a huge amount from them.â€? Bakr was hard on himself if his performance wasnâ€™t perfect This was a lesson learnt for Bakr, who always wanted to be the best version of himself in every task he took on. But if he didnâ€™t get something right first time, he was tough on himself. During a shift at the cheese factory, his responsibilities for the day didnâ€™t quite go according to plan. Bakr was disappointed in himself, it reflected in the way he spoke to his bosses and although they admired his honesty, it left him feeling guilty. Stacey adds: â€œSpeak up quietly before you reach a place where you feel uncomfortable. Itâ€™s absolutely fine to admit that you need help and no-one will mind, they will be pleased you talked to them about it.â€? Bakrâ€™s experience on The Nine to Five can be found here.
