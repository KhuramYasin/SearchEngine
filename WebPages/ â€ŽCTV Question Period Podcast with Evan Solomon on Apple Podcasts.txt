I get that COVID-19 and specifically the vaccine roll out is the big news story of the day, but when did this become The Evan Solomon Vaccine Hour? msunbeams , 2020-02-29 CTV is crap This is probably the best political analysis on CTV News. Evan Solomon tries to put the lie to everyoneâ€™s political spin but usually comes up short. Nic Nanos or Robert Fife are often the best parts of this show. Jcl1033 , 2020-12-28 Dec 27th episode Listening to the Dec 27th episode was painful. Calling out answers out of turn, whining about the results .... it was like listening to kindergarteners.
