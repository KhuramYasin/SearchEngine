Alexandra Miekus Published on November 18th, 2021 at 03:59pm EST Updated on November 18th, 2021 at 04:15pm EST Aa Accessibility Font Style Serif Sans Font Size A A Saskatchewan has invited 633 immigration candidates in the latestÂ invitationÂ round held on November 18. Following an almost two month break from conducting draws, Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP) invited candidates to apply through two of its immigration streams. Of those invited, 425 may be eligible for the SINPâ€™s Express Entry subcategory, and 208 may be eligible for the Occupations In-Demand sub-category. The lowest-scoring candidate from each sub-category had 65 points on Saskatchewanâ€™s Expression of InterestÂ (EOI) ranking system. Discover if Youâ€™re Eligible for Canadian Immigration In this draw, there were 14 eligible occupations for each category. The full list of eligible occupations can be found on Saskatchewan’s government website. Both groups also neededÂ Educational Credential AssessmentsÂ to demonstrate their foreign education was comparable to the Canadian standard. About Saskatchewanâ€™s Express Entry sub-category The Express Entry sub-category is an enhancedÂ Provincial Nominee ProgramÂ (PNP), meaning it is linked to the federalÂ Express Entry system. Express Entry manages the pool of candidates for three of Canadaâ€™s main economic-class immigration programs:Â Federal Skilled Worker Program,Â Federal Skilled Trades Program, andÂ Canadian Experience Class. Candidates with Express Entry profiles must also create EOI profiles for Saskatchewan in order to be considered for an invitation to apply for a provincial nomination. Express Entry candidates who receive a provincial nomination from the province of Saskatchewan are awarded an additional 600 points toward theirÂ Comprehensive Ranking SystemÂ score. This award effectively guarantees them a chance to apply for Canadian permanent residence. About the Occupations In-Demand subcategory TheÂ Occupations In-Demand sub-categoryÂ is a base PNP, meaning it is open to immigration candidates who do not have anÂ Express Entry profile. This sub-category is for highly skilled workers with experience in an in-demand occupation in Saskatchewan, who do not yet have a job offer in the province. In order to apply for Canadian immigration through this sub-category, foreign nationals need to create an EOI profile through the SINPâ€™s online application system. Saskatchewanâ€™s EOI system allows the province to select immigration candidates that have the potential to thrive in the prairie province. Candidates will be assessed on how their work experience, education, language ability, age, and connections to the province demonstrate their ability to settle in Saskatchewan.
