Riley says of his friend. â€œHeâ€™s like a brother to me.â€? The â€œyou had to be thereâ€? memories he shared kept the two from growing apart, despite Riley pursuing music and Steven becoming a dad. â€œHe was super excited to be a father,â€? Riley recalls. â€œI thought it was so special.â€? Riley shows me video he shot at Stevenâ€™s sonâ€™s birthday, before saying that young Grayson expressed the same exuberance for life his dad seemed to have. â€œIt would be impossible to not be smiling and laughing when you were with Steven,â€? Riley says. Which is why it felt impossible to not be crying after Riley received this text from a mutual friend: â€œHey man did you hear about Steven?â€? Riley reads the messages heâ€™ll never delete from his phone: â€œHe took his life last night.â€? â€œThere were really dark says after that,â€? Riley says. â€œI didnâ€™t want to talk about it.â€? And if he did, Riley wouldnâ€™t have known what to say. That is, until the first anniversary of Stevenâ€™s death. While Riley was working with his music team Yuzzynet, the words suddenly appeared. They wrote a song called â€œIn My Headâ€? to express their feelings of grief and guilt about Stevenâ€™s death, but also their gratitude for his friendship. When they were finished, they shared the song with Stevenâ€™s widow Braeleigh Winda. â€œItâ€™s upsetting. Itâ€™s sad,â€? Braeleigh says. â€œBut itâ€™s good, what theyâ€™re doing with it.â€? What theyâ€™re doing is using the songâ€™s music video to spread awareness about mental health, raise funds for their provincial crisis centre and share information on where to get help. â€œItâ€™s really nice,â€? Braeleigh says. â€œAnd I feel itâ€™ll be so good for Grayson to remember his dad.â€? You see, the video also includes that footage from Graysonâ€™s birthday party, including a touching moment where the two-year-old points up to a picture of his dad on the wall. â€œThereâ€™s going to be a time when (Grayson) asks, â€˜Who is my dad?â€™â€? Riley says. â€œAnd I want to be there to let him know how much (Steven) loved him and how special he was.â€? Riley recently performed the song for Grayson at a concert, and says heâ€™s committed to remain in the boyâ€™s life forever. â€œWe donâ€™t know who much time we have here,â€? Riley says. â€œWe have to live and love with our whole hearts and be there for each other.â€™â€?
